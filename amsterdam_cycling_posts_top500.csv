Amsterdam,Cycle safety - kids,"What can be done about cycle safety in Amsterdam? 

I ask since this morning I was cycling with my kids to primary school. I was 2-abreast with my smaller kid, when a cyclist overtook,  cut in, and clipped my front wheel and nearly sending me tumbling. I cycled up to him and asked what happened. His aggressive response was that I was at fault for taking up too much space and he did it deliberately. This from a grey haired man in his late 50's on a city bike. 

I'm used to children going 30 or 40 on bike paths on fatbikes,, I'm used to mopeds doing 40 or 50 through the Westerpark, I'm used to motorbikes taking to bike lanes when traffic is queuing on the road, but this really shook me up - the language he used was not part of the inburgeren exam I took - he deliberately caused a collision then got aggressive when I called him out on it.

I read this report (below) which says that less children are cycling to school and it chimes with my reality - it would be safer for me to drive them to school than to run the gauntlet of unsafe bike paths. 

It seems that in banning mopeds from bike lanes the risks have got worse not better. At least a moped  was accountable (number plate), insured, and had an APK with a rider had received instruction and was of a certain age. Fatbike riders have none of these things and seem to have create a dog-eat-dog environment where aggressive me-first riding has been normalised. 

  
I don't want to turn this into a rant - rather ask whether anything can be done? By the Gemeente for example? They put signs up in the Westerpark urging people to cycle safely, but TBH I can't see a simple sign changing the behaviour of someone who's decided to ride a motorbike through the park at 50kmh. On the one occasion (in 15 years of living in Amsterdam) that I saw a police officer try to stop a motorbike in a cycle lane, the rider turned tail and rode off. I asked the officer why he wasn't pursuing him - response - ""we're trained not to"".

I don't want to start driving my kids to school but am at a point when I think it's the only safe way to get them about. Ideas anyone?

Amsterdam,Amsterdam completely changed how I think about transport,"I come from a very car-centric family in Houston (lots of professional mechanics). Growing up, cars were the most discussed topic in our home. They were seen as a necessity, adult, reliable. Bikes were for kids or for people who couldn’t afford a car. That’s genuinely how I thought for most of my life.

Then I moved to Amsterdam with my kids and everything changed.

Here, bikes aren’t hobbies, they are how people live. You see families everywhere on bikes, parents hauling kids, groceries, even pets. It’s normal. The city is built for it. Dedicated bike lanes, bike traffic lights, actual space to ride safely. Once you get into the rhythm, it just makes sense.

Amsterdam completely changed how I used to think about daily commuting and what little doubt I had left got thrown out thanks to a neighbour who let me try their long cargo bike. A few rides were all it took for me to know this is what I wanted and I have never been happier with a decision in my life. Now I own my very own e-cargo bike (tarran t1 pro). My kid loves it, I love it and honestly, it’s hard to imagine going back.

But recently my family visited and safe to say they were shocked to see this change in my life. To them, relying on an e-cargo bike for everything seemed childish. They still see cars as necessities and couldn't appreciate the value of a bike. A $7,000 cargo bike came across as a luxury to them and a bad financial decision. But these are the same people driving $100,000 cars, paying insurance, fuel, maintenance, parking. Talking with them made me realise that when people buy a car, they mentally discard the cost. With an e-cargo bike, everything’s upfront but it gives back more than you’d expect (no fuel, no traffic, cheap insurance, minimal maintenance). People confuse that upfront cost with long term benefits because they still see bikes as leisure, not tools. And that’s the mindset that really needs to change.

I wanted my kid to have the safest, most comfortable ride possible so I got a bike that could actually handle it. With my oldest being four and my youngest two, I can see myself using this bike for a very long time. I couldn't convince my family that its not a phase I am going through so I thought I would take a moment to thank this city for changing how I move and how I parent.

Anyone else here for whom this city completely changed the way you think about getting around?",674,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amsterdam/comments/1o1hcfl/amsterdam_completely_changed_how_i_think_about/,1759945309.0,183,fallback_new,fallback,2025-10-08 17:41:49,25,3.0,0.0,25
Amsterdam,tips for people visiting Amsterdam for the first time,"from my wonderful 17 days I just returned from. Locals and others please add and correct. Maybe this stuff seems obvious but it wasn't to me until I got there.

* Arriving
   * There's a train station in the airport. How great is that? Easily train to the Central Station.
   * You get off the train and walk south, toward the city, away from the harbor.\* It's overwhelming, maybe a bit scary. Take a breath. This is the hardest transportation challenge you will face; it gets easier after this.
   * The trams are directly in front of you, between you and the city.
   * How do you know which tram to take? Use google maps, enter your hotel/hostel destination, choose public transportation. Easy.
   * There are a lot of tram stops here, so you need to look around and find yours. Each stop has a nice electronic board that tells you which trams are coming in how many minutes.
   * How will you pay for it/buy a ticket? So simple. For now, just use your bank card. Hold it up to the card reader by the door. Important, as the nice lady tells you every trip, ""Don't forget to check out with your bankcard."" This is for your sake, otherwise you get charged additional.

\*unless you are staying in Amsterdam Noord, in which case go the opposite way and take a free ferry across the harbor.

* Getting around
   * To me, as an American, the trams were amazing. They go everywhere you need to go in town and you don't have to deal with a station or anything, they go down the middle of the street.
   * I bought a 7 day pass so I wouldn't have to think about cost and could go where I liked. There are other options through the GVB app. If you prefer to deal with a person, there is a GVB office, white building past the trams in front of the station. If you don't want to deal with any of it, use your bankcard. I assume this costs more? IDK
   * Enter the ""welcome"" door, not an exit door, put your card or phone up to the reader. Exit through an exit door and ""Don't forget to check out with your bankcard."" There is an electronic board that tells you the next few stops and when you are at a stop, connecting lines from there. By your second ride you'll be a pro.
   * There is also a metro system, entrances underground. Day passes include trams, busses, metro and ferries. The metro is also super easy to use and is faster for long distances. Everything is clear from the abundant signage in English. Use your card or phone to go through the entrance stiles and go.
   * I found uber to be a pain in the ass as the city was built long before cars. Especially true during busy times.
   * Many people rent a bike. I didn't because it just looked overwhelming to me.
   * Walking is the best way to get to know the city. IMPORTANT: The bikes have right of way. This is no joke. There are many people whipping around on bikes literally everywhere. A big boulevard will have: sidewalk, bike lane, car lane, tram track, tram track, car lane, bike lane, sidewalk. That's a lot. Sometimes the bike path might look like a pedestrian path. So just, any time you cross anything, look for the bikes. They may warn you with a bell, but they will not stop for you. Cars stop for you in zebra crossings; bikes not so much.
   * For me, the central are near Dam square is awful. It's interesting and historic, but crammed with people like god damn Disneyland and tons of tourist oriented shops. I recommend staying even a little way out, in the Jordaan, De Pijp, toward OosterPark, Noord, or anywhere else. Don't worry about getting to stuff you want to see in this area, because again, the trams. You could even stay in Haarlem or a small town outside of Amsterdam and take the train in in literally minutes.
* Saving money. It's an expensive city. I'm cheap/frugal so found some ways to save money.
   * Buy some groceries at Albert Heijn or other supermarkets, at a street market, etc. Saves big.
   * I stayed at a hostel. IDK if there are cheaper alternatives.
   * The museums are expensive but excellent. Choose wisely.
   * There is a CityPass but I didn't get one so IDK if it saves you or not.
   * I like the free ferry across the harbor.
   * There is an amazing view of the city from the top floor of the main branch of the city library, between the Central Station and the science museum.
   * Hang out in a park. Sometimes on Sunday you may find a free concert or something; I did.

YMMV on any of this. I hope this helps someone and that it is permissible in this sub.",115,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amsterdam/comments/1ndm4c4/tips_for_people_visiting_amsterdam_for_the_first/,1757528552.0,84,Amsterdam bike,search,2025-09-10 18:22:32,25,3.0,2.0,25
Amsterdam,Pyongyang really is an upgraded version of Amsterdam,"I don’t even know where to begin. I spent two weeks in Pyongyang, and let me tell you: Amsterdam could NEVER.

Let’s start with the streets. In Pyongyang? Immaculate. You could eat off the pavement. Not a single drunk Brit peeing in a canal. Not a single crusty junkie harassing you for change. Just wide boulevards, synchronized traffic, and not a single fucking bicycle in sight. Meanwhile in Amsterdam, if you don’t get mowed down by a fixie-riding finance bro, you’ll be dodging scooters ridden by teenagers live-streaming on TikTok.

Safety? I could leave my bag on a park bench in Pyongyang and come back a week later—still there. Amsterdam? I left my bike for ten minutes and came back to find just the sad remains of a broken lock. Say what you want, but you don’t need ten surveillance cameras per street corner when the entire population’s on the same page.

Don’t even get me started on the people. Polite, well-dressed, not constantly baked out of their minds. No one screaming in English about “muh freedoms” while simultaneously throwing up in a trash can. In Pyongyang, people walk with purpose. In Amsterdam? Everyone’s either a lost tourist, an Instagram influencer, or a 40-year-old man in a Canada Goose jacket yelling “kankerhoer” into his phone.

And the architecture? You ever see Juche Tower? Monumental. Inspiring. Not some crumbling 1600s house-turned-coffee shop with seven shades of mold and a €3000/month rent tag.

Public transport? Timely. Clean. Uniformed attendants. None of that NS bullshit where the train shows up twenty minutes late and then skips your stop entirely because the driver “feels unsafe.”

Honestly, I don’t think I can ever go back to Amsterdam. I’ve seen the light. I’ve tasted true order.

Pyongyang > Amsterdam.

Amsterdam,Spat on face by kids on Fatbikes,"Around 6pm yesterday I took my bike to go play football around Westerpark.   
  
On the bike lane I see a fat bike with 2 kids coming the wrong way super fast, which made me had to swerve to the right. When the 2 kids pass by me they spat in my face. I stop my bike in complete shock. That's when I see another fat bike with another kid coming a few meters behind. I look at him looking for empathy but he also spits on my face. At this point I was feeling even more in shock and humiliated.   
  
I look to the side and there's an old gentleman who witnessed the whole thing who starts comforting me and say things like ""these kids today are horrible, they have no respect. Im so sorry this happened. they will get theirs eventually"". For context the old gentleman was a dutch man of asian or suriname background. (I say this because I dont want this topic to become a racist topic of ""immigrants are bad"". I'm a immigrant myself and I'm a black european).   
  
On the way back from football I see again 2 kids on fatbikes in the very same road I had the incident and it made me feel scared even though I didnt know if they were the same kids. In that same area I saw a group of police officers and went to speak to them about the incident. The police was very sorry for what happened but at the end just said ""these kids on fatbikes are a bit of ***nuisance***"".  
  
So I came home and tried to have a normal evening but then when I tried to fall sleep I couldn't. Even though my body was tired from the football. In my mind I tried to be sympathetic for the aggressors, tried to find positive ways to spin it, tried to let it go but nothing really worked except putting a podcast to lull me to sleep. I only managed to fall asleep around 5am but kept waking up until now 9am.   
  
Btw also on the way back from football I saw a black lady having a bike accident and I went to help her out. I bring this up because as I went to help her, another guy also came running to help her. And this guy was the same ethnicity as the kids on the fat bikes. He was super caring and I left the black lady to his care. I bring this up, because the point of my post is not about ""race X is bad"" is about trying to understand why kids today are behaving like this. I grew up in school with ""tough kids"" from ""bad neighbourhoods"" but they were never this cold and dismissive of another human being.  
  
At the end of the day I feel really sad, angry and powerless because it was such a cowardly assault. I can still feel the hot saliva on my face even though I washed my face several times.  
  
Now I googled ""kids on fat bike amsterdam"" and this reddit post was the very first result.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Amsterdam/comments/1dmpm2n/spat\_on\_face\_by\_kid\_on\_fatbike/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amsterdam/comments/1dmpm2n/spat_on_face_by_kid_on_fatbike/)

Amsterdam,35 sqm apartment at Buitenveldert Amsterdam VS 60 sqm apartment at Diemen Centre,"I'm currently trying to buy an apartment on my own (budget: 330k max) and have been looking at properties near Gelderlandplein, Amsterdam Zuid. Most of the apartments I can afford are around 320k with 35 square meters, all built in 1960s, with energy label B-D . The location is excellent — it has two large parks and one smaller park nearby, plus easy access to the Gelderlandplein shopping mall, Zuidas, VU, Oud Zuid and Amstelveen as well. All of these are within walking or cycling distance, and even De Pijp or further areas are reachable by bike in under 25 minutes.I’ve lived here for 3 years and I really like the neighborhood — it's peaceful (but not too quiet), green, safe, convenient, and has a diverse, multinational community.

The concern I have at the moment is that the apartments I can afford here are quite small. A 35 sqm apartment would likely require me to move again in the future if my living needs change (unless I have a very strict space management). And if I need to upgrade during a market downturn, I might have no choice but to sell the smaller apartment at a loss. On the other hand, if I were to buy a slightly larger apartment — say, 55 to 60 sqm at a less central area, I might not feel the need to move for quite a while. That would reduce the risk of being forced to sell at a bad time.

Therefore, I’ve also started looking at apartments in Diemen.

From what I’ve seen, quite a few 59–60 sqm apartments with asking price 325k have been listed on Funda in the past year, especially around Tobias Asserlaan street and the surrounding area. The location seems nice — it's close to the Diemenplein shopping mall and Diemen Station. The commute to Amsterdam Zuid, De Pijp, or the 9 Straatjes takes about 35–40 minutes, which is roughly 10–15 minutes longer than from Buitenveldert, Amsterdam. So I keep asking myself: is it worth spending a little more time commuting in exchange for a more spacious apartment in a less central neighborhood?

I expect to live alone for several more years, and having a very very safe neighborhood is a top priority for me. Diemen seems nice, but it has more of a family-oriented vibe. The local facilities aren't as well-developed as those near Gelderlandplein, and it’s slightly less convenient when it comes to accessing the rest of Amsterdam.

At the same time, the value retention is my second biggest concern when buying property. I don’t expect a huge return on my apartment, but I do want to minimize the risk of financial loss, especially if the economy takes a downturn — which I believe is quite possible in the next few years :(

All of this has been a bit overwhelming, so I’d really appreciate any insights or thoughts you might have. Thank you! 😊

Amsterdam,I had a hard time in Amsterdam,"Hi, I'm an ordinary traveler who visited Amsterdam last week. 



The canal was so beautiful and I had good experiences sometimes, but I think there were many difficulties



I was told that Amsterdam's bike lanes are stained with traveler's blood lol

I thought this was exaggerated and went without thinking about it, but it hit a bicycle and it really bled 



I know, I was careless, there's a bicycle culture in the Netherlands, and they come first



Cars have a continuous signal system, and that's why people who walk cross safely, right?



But bikes don't have as many signals as cars, and the problem is that they think they're the priority and just look ahead and drive 



So I felt like the bike was a tank throughout the trip.

Netherlands,E-scooter use allowed in the Netherlands since July,"Just discovered that

>**E-scooter use allowed in the Netherlands since July**

>Since July 1, 2025, it has been legal to use an e-scooter on the streets of the Netherlands. The electric scooter now falls into the category of special mopeds, allowing anyone over the age of 16 to ride the scooters on Dutch cycle paths, provided they have an official blue licence plate and do not go faster than 25 kilometres per hour. Drivers of e-scooters are also not required to wear helmets.

>There has been growing concern as an increasing number of faster vehicles are allowed on bike paths, creating dangerous situations. Dutch municipalities are even set to experiment with speed limits on cycle paths to combat this issue. The addition of e-scooters on the roads has the potential to exacerbate the situation.

I have only one question: **Why?**

Those scooters are cancer for the cities and many cities are banning them. Good that Amsterdam is already looking into countermeasures. But what about other cities? Why did they need to allow them in the first place? I think personal use is okay, but not rentals.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Netherlands/comments/1m23k0j/escooter_use_allowed_in_the_netherlands_since_july/,1752746530.0,26,Amsterdam cycling,search,2025-07-17 10:02:10,17,0.0,3.0,17
thenetherlands,Getting a driver's licence: My experience ,"Hello guys, there is a text that I wrote for a Turkish social media platform about getting a license here, then I figured it could fit here as well so I translated it and now sharing it with you. I think especially those who are looking to get a license here in the Netherlands can benefit from this text.

On my fourth attempt, I finally passed the driving exam. I’m writing this to give some insight to those planning to get a license in the Netherlands—and to let out my frustration, of course. It's going to be a long one because I’ll try to cover everything I remember. Here goes.

Let’s start with the theory part. Just like in Turkey, before you can take the practical test, you need to pass the theory exam. Once you pass the theory exam, you get 1.5 years to pass the practical exam. If you don’t do it within that time, you’ll need to redo the theory test to take the practical one.

From what I understand, most of the theoretical rules here are similar to Turkey’s, probably because Turkey has adjusted its regulations to align with EU standards. For instance, traffic signs mostly mean the same thing. Some driving schools offer classes specifically to prepare you for the theory exam. I skipped those and instead studied on [thiswebsite](https://www.theorieexamen.nl/theorie-examens?ref=gad&keyword=theorie%20examen&ref=gad&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADMHqI37o3qnKz_qpJUWeaAxyurYH&gclid=Cj0KCQiAoae5BhCNARIsADVLzZeoAlIxTOca_kXVKoSNykRevvozi8G6WPT80bWDAG-I7WaZJd0zOOAaAiZXEALw_wcB). A one-week membership costs around €14, and I totally recommend it because the exercises and lessons there are great.

In the theory exam, they start by asking about road signs and their meanings. After that, there are questions about the car itself. Then they show you real-life scenarios and give you about 5 (?) seconds to respond with what you would do in that situation. Here, it’s especially crucial to know who has priority in different scenarios—for example, giving way to someone coming from the right, or if someone coming from across you is turning left while you’re going straight, you have the right of way. By studying the materials on that website, I passed on my first attempt; honestly, it wasn’t too hard. At the end of the exam, you immediately find out if you passed or not. My advice is to pass the theory test first before starting any practical lessons. Some schools might not even let you start until you’ve passed the theory.

Now for the practical part. Friends, driving in the Netherlands—at least to the standard needed to pass the test—is a whole other story compared to Turkey. One of the main reasons is that the road design here is completely different; it feels like they’ve set it up like a computer game. Random obstacles, lanes that narrow and widen for no reason, weird roundabouts—it’s wild. You really need a lot of practice to get used to the Dutch road infrastructure.

The second issue is the bikes. You especially have to be careful with them when you’re leaving roundabouts or turning off main roads, because they can appear from literally anywhere. It’s important in the test but also a real threat once you’re actually on the road here.

Let’s talk about choosing a driving school (rijschool) first. Especially if you live in the Randstad area and are new to the country, there’s a major scam these schools will pull on you. Here’s how it goes: they offer as many lessons as you want—15 hours, 20 hours, whatever—and during the lessons, they don’t actually teach you much, just intervene in critical moments. Then they send you to the exam unprepared, you fail, of course, and then get back on Reddit to rant. Then you get ready again with the same school, and before you know it, you’ve failed for the second time.

So, what should be the most important criterion when picking a school? It’s definitely the pass rate of its students. I recommend checking this on CBR’s [website](https://www.cbr.nl/nl/vergelijk-rijscholen-met-de-cbr-rijschoolzoeker) and avoiding schools with a pass rate below 60%. Yes, these schools technically give you lessons, but the real money is in their students constantly failing and taking more lessons. Talk about a system! I failed my first three tests with the same school and worked with a different one for the fourth attempt; DM me if you want the name of the new one!

So, we’ve passed the theory test and found a reliable school with a pass rate above 60%. What’s next? I met so many people who have been driving for years in Turkey but still had to retake the test here, sometimes even a second or third time. So, this isn’t about being a “pro” driver; it’s about understanding the Dutch infrastructure and following their road rules, plus doing things that will impress the examiner during the test.

The first thing you’ll learn, and probably find ridiculously excessive—like every non-Dutch person does—is that every time you change lanes, turn right or left, or even pull over to the side, you must always, always, always first check your rearview mirror, then the side mirrors, and finally, check your blind spot by looking over your shoulder. Only after that can you signal. Don’t even think of saying, “Why bother?” or “Aren’t the mirrors enough?” or “The road’s empty anyway.” Every time: rearview, side, shoulder. No exceptions.

Okay, now that we’ve got the looking part down, let’s talk about speed limits. If you go over the speed limit, you fail. Simple enough, right? But what’s truly wild here is that on about 80% of the roads, the speed limit isn’t actually posted anywhere! You’re just supposed to know. How? That’s where those 20-30 hours of lessons come in handy. After enough practice, you start picking up on the road design and can guess the speed limit based on that. Once you can recognize the difference between a 30, 50, 60, and 80 km/h road just by looking, you’re getting somewhere.

Another thing about speed limits: just as you’ll fail if you go over the limit, you’ll also fail if you’re too far under it! I know, it sounds insane. Like, here I am driving 45 in a 50 zone because I feel safer that way, and they’re like, “Nope.” Speed limits here aren’t like Turkey, where you just need to stay below the limit—here, they want you to actually go the exact speed, as long as conditions allow. If it’s a 50 zone and the road is clear, you need to be going 50. No going 30 in a 50, or 20 in a 30 zone. I’m dead serious—people fail because they drive just 5 km/h below the limit. During my last test, the examiner even reminded me to go exactly at the speed limit.

So, what’s the goal during all these lessons? I’d say 50% is genuinely learning to drive safely on your own, and the other 50% is about impressing the examiner. They want to see that you can drive (these two words are critical, by the way, they might even ask you these exact terms before the test—they did for me) “safely” and “on your own.” So you basically have to become a bit of a show-off when you’re driving. At every junction, every traffic light, every time you have the right of way, you need to keep looking all around—left, right, back, forward—and more importantly, make it super obvious that you’re looking. This part is essential.

So we’ve got the looking-around habit down, we understand speed limits, we’re neither over nor under, so far so good. Next up is pedestrian crossings. If there’s anything that makes Europe *Europe*, besides the wealth from colonial times, it’s that cars stop for pedestrians. If you ignore a pedestrian and try to drive on like you’re in Turkey, the examiner will slam the brakes so hard your head will spin, and then you’ll be back at the CBR in tears. Here, it’s not just about stopping if there’s a pedestrian crossing; you’re also expected to slow down if you see someone approaching a crossing. Yep, Holland also teaches you to read minds.

Then we have roundabouts, one of the great Dutch miracles. Honestly, roundabouts here are what this concept is supposed to look like, as opposed to the ones in Turkey that still have traffic lights. Here, it’s simple: you give way to whoever’s already in the roundabout, and if it’s clear, you go in. Basic rules: if you’re taking the third exit (going left), you enter the roundabout with your left blinker on; if it’s the first exit (going right), right blinker; going straight? No blinker. And as you leave, you signal right. And an extra bit of caution here: if there are bikes on the outside of the roundabout, you must yield to them as you exit. So yes, as you leave the roundabout, you go full monkey mode, looking right, left, ahead, and behind to make sure there’s no bike in sight.

Another important thing: yielding to cars on your right. Here’s the tricky part: you could be driving at 60, see a road on your right at the last minute, and bam—you didn’t slow down in time and just failed. Luckily, in the city at 30 km/h, this is easier to manage. You see a road on the right, slow down to about 10-15 km/h, look carefully, and if no car or bike is coming, you go. This rule is the single most important part of Dutch driving culture. You need to be super attentive to it.

Then there’s the highway. My God, this part makes my blood boil every time I think about it. So, you’re on the ramp to merge, going around 85-90, and you see a truck coming up very slowly in the left lane, so you can merge safely. You check your rearview, side mirrors, shoulder, put on your signal, and start merging slowly—then suddenly, BAM! The examiner slams the gas, and you’re glued to the seat. Why? Because, as we’ve discussed, you must be driving at the speed limit. If conditions allow, you’re expected to enter the highway at 100. No excuses.

And one more highway rule: you can’t stay in the left lane unless you’re passing someone. This one’s actually great; you never see people just chilling at 80 in the left lane. But here’s the strange part: you also can’t chill in the right lane if you’re doing 80 either! At least for the exam. Say you merge onto the highway, you’re in the right lane, but there’s a truck ahead doing 80. Your exit is coming up soon, and the right lane is crowded, so passing and getting back over could be tough. But hey, doesn’t matter—our goal is to go the speed limit. So you switch to the left lane, get up to 100, and stay there until you’re about 600 meters from your exit. And also, put on your right blinker at around 300 meters to the exit.

Speaking of which, in the city, you also have to stay in the right lane whenever possible. So if you’re on a two-lane road, you should always be in the right lane unless there’s a slow vehicle in front of you. Also, if you’re in the right lane at a light and there’s a truck ahead, it’s okay to switch to the left lane.

Lastly, let’s talk about “bijzondere verrichtingen,” or special maneuvers. There are a few of these: reversing, reverse parking, forward parking, parallel parking, hill starts, U-turns, and three-point turns. During the test, they’ll ask you to perform two of these. I won’t go into all of them, but you can check them out in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9STm8-fASM).

Here’s something interesting: there isn’t a designated parking area for these. They might take you to a random street and say, “Find an appropriate spot on this street to parallel park.” My advice? Don’t just park in the first empty space—take your time, go down the street, and find a spot that really works. Also, they don’t expect you to park perfectly on your first try. Let’s say you’re reversing and see it’s not going to fit; just go forward a bit and try again. The main thing is not that you nail it right away but that you perform the maneuver in a “safe” way.

So, U-turns, parking—all good, but remember, the whole time you need to act like a monkey, constantly looking left, right, forward, and back. Every time you check your mirrors or look over your shoulder, you’re essentially showing the examiner that you are keeping it all safe. Make it clear you’re aware of your surroundings the entire time.

Let’s talk about the test itself. First of all, getting a test appointment takes at least three months, so the earliest date you’ll find will be three months from now. That means you’ll have three months to keep practicing with lessons. And if you fail, well, that’s another three-month wait, unfortunately. Here’s another wild bit: if you fail four times, the fifth test is longer and more relaxed, taking about 1.5 hours instead of 35 minutes, and they even give you a break halfway through. Thankfully, I didn’t need it, but good to know, right?

You can book the test date yourself, but I suggest having your school handle it. The fee is around €300. Lessons also cost around €60-70 per hour, so it’s definitely not cheap. Anyway, let’s say the day of the test arrives. The exams start at your local CBR testing center. You’ll take the test in your school’s car.

The exam lasts around 35 minutes. First, they’ll take you through regular city streets. They might say “turn right” or “turn left,” and if they don’t give you any instructions, just keep driving straight. They’ll probably squeeze in the special maneuvers within the first 10-15 minutes. After that, they’ll take you onto the highway and check if you’re following the rules we talked about earlier. Then, they’ll put on the navigation and ask you to follow it back to the CBR center. You park the car, get out with your hands probably shaking, go back inside the CBR building, sit down, and find out whether you passed or not—and if not, exactly why you failed. Then you go to Reddit and share your experience with everyone.

Netherlands,Biking tour,"Hello all,

A couple friends and I are planning a biking tour around the Netherlands and would like to run it by people who live there to make sure it makes sense. Our current plan is to fly to Amsterdam, then bike tu Utrecht, spend a day/night there, then bike to The Hague, another day/night there and then back to Amsterdam.

This the route I was quickly able to get on Google maps:

https://maps.app.goo.gl/FVujCyyz1GZG2e3S9?g_st=ic

I wanted to know if this look like a reasonable plan. Maybe someone can spot some pitfalls that may make this impossible? We bike on a regular basis, so we’re more concerned about the logistics of roads and safety.

Also, I’ll take any recommendations of places where we can rent bikes for multiple days and places where we can leave our luggage in Amsterdam for a couple days.

Thanks!

bicycling,I was hit by a car but did not called the police?,"4 days ago, while I was heading back home, a driver collided with me and I fell off from the bike. Basically, I had priority because I was on the cycle lane and it was a main road, plus there was front and rear light on the bike. He wanted to turn left from a small road into the opposite road. According to him he was not able to see me. An other driver was coming backwards and that car blocked his view. Luckily, no break or head injury, only hit the left feet badly and right calf area, plus a few bruises. I did not called the police that evening. Because of the accident I was not able to work 3 days and the full recovery going to take an another few days too.

The guy stopped and took me to emergency and afterwards back home with the damaged bicycle. We have agreed that he is going to pay for the repairs of the bike on the day of the accident. We swapped numbers too. I had to order a new saddle from Amazon and told him about this today but he was not aware it was damaged too, so he wrote a text reply that the repair was not an admission of the collision being his fault and I should be aware that I was wearing black clothing with no cycle helmet and high vis vest. He added he is trying to do the right thing morally.

He is supposed to pick me up tomorrow afternoon with the bike and go to the bike shop for repair. But what if he is not going to show up or do not want to pay for the repair, then what could I do in that case?  
Any advice?

cycling,Fixie or freewheel-single speed?,"TLDR: I need a new bike. I want it to be reliable,  low-maintenance, and nukeproof (not necessarily the brand, lol)

So today I had a pretty rough crash in the 
middle of Amsterdam because once again my city bike broke. I didn't do anything crazy -I got out of the saddle, pushed on the paddles, and my freewheel broke at over 30kmph, so I went straight over the bars. This time it could've ended up in me under a car.

As I went flying towards the pavement, the voice in my head went something like ""_sigh_ here we go again"" -it was the third time I crashed because a bike gave out.

Yes, I do put them through a fair bit of abuse -I'm 100kg, I'm a fit cyclist, put quite a bit of power in, do tricks etc. I don't want to crash because of a bike breaking again.

Is it affordable (perhaps more so than buying a 'normal' 2nd hand bike) to buy a fixie, single-speed with a freewheel, or something similar, or DIY it? I want my next bike to be Rik-proof and have a sporty geometry akin to my roadbike or mountainbike, so I'll be faster, and it should have low maintenance- no shimano nexus nonsense, just things I can mostly fix and maintain myself.

Does anyone have any recommendations on what to do? I'm writing this at night worried about some things and with pain in my hip, so excuse the lack of layout.

Many thanks!

Edit: so I'm mostly pondering about a single speed, but with free wheel and brakes. I'm trying to figure out where to look for a frame and components that won't break the bank. I'll need a solid aluminium or steel frame with a mount suitable for shimano 105 or ultegra rim brakes (disc brakes wouldn't be worth it, considering the bike will be outside a lot).",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/1jfcchm/fixie_or_freewheelsingle_speed/,1742430496.0,9,Amsterdam bike,search,2025-03-20 00:28:16,15,3.0,2.0,15
cycling,My optimism roads (at least in France),"I am happy to say some parts of France are moving in a good direction. What percentage I don’t know but I see this in Southern France around the Mougins-Nice area.

Multiple sections, lanes or sub lanes on each road.

\- One for pedestrians

\- One for bicyles and escooters under a certain speed

\- The road for motor vehicles are to be shared with motorbikes (usually on the left side of the lane) and fast going performance cyclists or commuters on ebikes (ideally on the right side of the lane so we can slow down and go into the slower bike lane when necessary or vice versa) or fast going e-scooters.

\- One road lane for public transport, taxis, emergency usage. I think cycling teams can officially use this segment but I’m not sure. Of course they would not have the right of the way if an ambulance is coming.

This setup misses one group: runners. They often use the right side of the bike lane if the sidewalk is crowded. Overall I’m quite happy here except the tourists who drive cars. They really drive bad particularly in the Cannes area.

One hardship is vehicle parking. The (motorcar) lanes are in the middle of the road and so car/motorbike parking has to be between the bike lanes and the sidewalk. Handling this complexity in a city that’s 100 to 500+ years old and has narrow roads is much tougher because one has to account so many other things such as road signaling, city lighting, passive road safety measures, public transportation, tree roots and so on.

I think urban road design is among the toughest topics there is and the French are really good at it.

Do you like your roads, do you see an improvement in terms of design? I remember watching a very nice you tube channel called not just bikes. Learned a lot from his videos.

Could you also tell me which city is the best in your view? I’d like to go there for a bike vacation. Amsterdam I know and like (great place to be in the heat of the summer) but perhaps there is another city out there...

thenetherlands,Travelling to Utrecht and Volendam - Renting through Ov-fiets,"Hi everybody,

I'm a tourist from France who's coming to visit Utrecht and Volendam in early august.   
I'll be visiting with my partner and some family and we'd like to experience the dutch way of travelling, i.e with a bike. 

I did some research and found out that you need an ov-chipkaard to rent bike through Ov-fiets, a card that you can only get with a Dutch bank account (which I obviously dont have). If you dont have one, there seems to be an alternative which is called a Region Pass that you can order a few weeks before your trip and that allows you to rent bikes through Ov-fiets, you just have to pick up the card at a station in Utrecht or Amsterdam. 

Therefore, I have questions about this : 

\- Does the region pass still exists ? If so, how can I manage to get one ? All the links I've seen that should have redirected me to the actual procedure are inactive. 

\- I had hip surgery earlier this month and even If I'll be able to bike, I'd rather rent an e-bike to unload some stress out of my hip. Is it possible to rent an e-bike with this pass ? Is it easy to find e-bikes to rent ? 

\- And last question, I'll be travelling through Utrecht and Volendam, If I get this pass in Utrecht, will it also be usable in Volendam (Or the nearest station) ?

Thanks to those who'll take time to read me and answer those questions,   
Have a good day ! ",9,https://www.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/1m5ip2u/travelling_to_utrecht_and_volendam_renting/,1753103927.0,11,Amsterdam bike,search,2025-07-21 13:18:47,14,1.0,2.0,14
Netherlands,Thoughts on cycling from Amsterdam to Den Helder / Texel,"Hello, this summer my partner and I wanted to visit Texel and a few other West Frisian islands and have a short cycling holiday. After a bit of investigation it looks as if quickly hopping from island to island with hire bikes isn't going to be as simple as we'd thought and instead I am trying to convince her that maybe we should spend a day or two riding from Amsterdam to Texel, spend a few days on Texel and then head back via public transport.

I wondered if anyone could offer much advice on how fun / scenic the [https://www.fietsknoop.nl/](https://www.fietsknoop.nl/) generated route from Amsterdam to Den Helder (attached) would be on bike - many years ago I had a great time riding around just north of Amsterdam, but a few years ago my partner and I rode arond utrecht and had mixed results (I think i probably didn't do a strict enough job of sticking to the LF routes but I am not 100% sure) - we're enthusiastic cyclists but not experienced bike packers or anything - ideally we're looking for something scenic and low traffic / stress

Be safe out there, ALWAYS wear a helmet and stay visible (lights, highvis)

Well I had my first crash today after commuting for a couple months. Was riding down a big road (no bike lane) at speed (15-20 mph) at night, and I was distracted by a pickup behind me that appeared to not be paying attention (thankfully they were). It was riding up behind me at speed and not changing lanes. Right after one of these glances over my shoulder to check that car, I looked back ahead and there are tracks. Before I can think my wheel turns and im on the ground. I hear the pickup hit its brakes then speed off, and I get out of the road as fast as I can. Thankfully, I am uninjured besides a sprained toe and lots of little scrapes. The only damage I noticed on my bike was a turned handle bar which I have already corrected. Very scary and i am lucky to be alive and relatively uninjured. Will definately be investing in some mirrors and taking a different route from now on. Im glad I was wearing a helmet, bright shirt, and flashing rear light. They probably saved my life. Be safe out there, ALWAYS wear a helmet and stay visible (lights, highvis).

Netherlands,Help (Re)-Learning to Ride a Bike,"Hello!

Also posted in r/Amsterdam but posting here in case someone has some other insights. 

I arrived in Amsterdam earlier this week and turns out the saying “just like riding a bike” doesn’t apply to me. Perhaps I didn’t learn all the fundamentals when I was young but it felt like I’d never been on a bike before and cycling back home on the Swapfiets I overconfidently rented was harrowing to say the least.

I’ve gone through old posts here where people have asked the same question and I’ve gotten some great tips I’ll be implementing – working on balance, practicing in a park etc.

What I’m really after though is a teacher. I know myself and I learn far better if I can ask questions and there’s someone I can talk to. I’ve contacted Jimmy from Koala Bike Lessons and he only has availability in June and so far, community centers have lessons at times that don’t work for someone with a job. Does anyone know another private teacher or would be willing to give me some lessons that could start asap? I really feel I’d be missing out lots if I don’t learn to cycle.

I’m based in Westerpark, super close to the park.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Netherlands/comments/1jvrbmi/help_relearning_to_ride_a_bike/,1744266455.0,3,Amsterdam cycling,search,2025-04-10 06:27:35,13,0.0,3.0,13
cycling,My best advice to newcomers,"After trying everything and coming full circle these are my points:  
1. Don't chase the numbers. They are irrevelant. The only metric that matters is time spent pedalling.  
Comparison is a theft of joy.  
2. Comfort and safety are more important than saving a few watts. Extending your rides gives more benefits.  
3. Try finding joy in all of it. This is the key to not burning out. Whether it's MTB, zone 2 meditation, bikepacking, climbing famous world tour mountains. Try everything and see what works best.   
4. Don't fight the traffic. You can't win. I tried and failed miserably. You can have dash cams, bike radar but they won't stop a lorry trying to push you off the road. I have even sold my road bike to get a gravel that would allow me to ride those poor condition bike lanes. Being the right one won't save you from dying under a truck.  
5. Get a proper bike fit. Our bodies can adjust to any bad position, but it's the single best way to improve your performance and comfort. One can even argue that a properly fitted steel bike can outperform a poorly fitted carbon one. We tend to spend a lot of money on gadgets, but after getting a fit we can only think 'why so late?'.  
6. Buy a bike only after checking the terrain where you will ride it. Not the other way round. It's a very common mistake. People see a road bike and imagine themselves riding on that perfect tarmac and smashing all PRs and KOMs on those slick tires. When in reality tarmac in their area is in a terrible state and full of sunken manholes. Boy was I surprised that real world road cycling looked nothing like on TV. Same goes for gravel bikes, you will suffer on anything other than a champagne gravel.

cycling,Biking in America vs Italy/France/Nederlands,"
This year has been a really big bike year for me. I learned a lot about a sport I love to watch from just riding the same roads as the pros, racing some crits, and riding in a group ride that is filled with Cat 2 and 3 racers where we have 5 designated race sections. 

But riding in Europe is just completely different. And somehow, Colorado is worse than Tennessee. 

Story time: I'm stoned and I need to rant, with some background. 

I got to ride 400km of unique road around Leiden, Amsterdam. Not fucking once did the concern of getting hit by a car cross my mind. I put some fucking miles down and I've never felt more free in my life. I could bike far, see cool shit, and not worry about a car killing me.

I got to see the climb up Col du Galibier in person this year. I rode up there from the village below the climb. I can't tell you how at home I felt to be with that many cyclists. Once the tour came through, we fucking mobbed down the Col du Lauteret. Hundreds of people, of various skill levels, biking down a mountain pass is a beautiful thing. Especially when you're putting the watts down and you get on to a train and start trading pulls with strangers that you trust because you can see their line choices. 

Then the next day I climbed Col du Granon and Col du Galbier. Holy shit the pro riders are strong. That broke me. It's been years since I've hurt that bad. And for those men, it's just day 16 of 21. But also, there were so many cyclists out riding their bikes that there are photographers who take candid photos to sell to you. 

Then I move to Colorado for the winter. I got yelled at today to ride on the sidewalk by several cars when I was doing 18 in a 25. Then on the way down from the climb, there were other cyclists going up. Which was really cool to see. I was hella stoked and trying to cheer them on when I saw them. 

And then this fucking car driving too fast goes to pass a cyclist climbing uphill swings out in my lane while I'm doing 50kmh downhill at it. Like, what the fuck?!?! I never even had this shit happen to me in Tennessee, and definitely not in Europe. I got harassed in Tennessee, but not like this. It's like every damn time I go out on my bike here in Colorado someone almost hits me. I don't freaking get it. And after knowing what it can be like from famous biking areas in France to just the general freedom and safety in the Nederlands...

cycling,Hit by a car rant,"Prefacing this because I can already see the comments: I know I’m SOL and I owe the money. Not looking for advice, just frustrated at the US car insurance system and road laws.

Just under a year ago I was hit on a pleasure ride and my bike was totaled. Lots of hard to find older parts and carefully selected bits and bobs totaled out to over $5000. Not to mention the camera I was carrying… Not a crazy bike but special to me and had a cool story behind it. I was in the road, lady in front of me had her hazards on and turned into my path causing me to graze the side of her car and my bike got pulled under and run over. I got a concussion, infected road rash but overall nothing crazy thankfully. 

I filed a claim with her insurance and they somehow found me at fault after refusing to collect video evidence from the nearby businesses to prove that she cut me off and didn’t signal. Claimed it was because I was in the road and not the bike lane even though my state explicitly states that’s not a legal claim for insurance companies to make. Expected this to disappear since she got off on pure luck and there was no way I damaged her vehicle enough to make an insurance claim. 

Anyways, today I get a call that I owe her insurance company almost $1000 for damages to her car, which from my memory there was nothing visible at all. This lady owns a $3.5million home and is coming after me personally for damage that was likely already on her car after I was injured and lost $5k due to her not looking in her mirrors. Not worth pursuing legal action as it’ll likely cost more than this claim, so I’m basically stuck paying for my injuries, bike, and this mystery damage to her car. 

All this to say, the US system sucks, as a cyclist you’re uninsured and insurance companies will suck you for every $ if there’s any grey area. Ride safe and fuck cars.

Hi all,

I’m considering biking from Bullewijk station (Amsterdam Zuidoost) to Amsterdam Zuid or RAI for my commute, and I’m wondering how realistic this is. Google Maps shows it’s around 8–10 km, which doesn’t sound too bad, but I have a few concerns:

* Some stretches look quite remote, with little lighting or housing nearby — is it safe to bike there, especially in the evenings?
* How much does wind affect the ride, especially along the Amstel or more open areas?
* Do people regularly make this commute by bike, or is it more common to just take the train/metro instead?

Would love to hear from anyone with experience on this route — whether it’s worth it, or if public transport is the smarter choice.

Thanks!

Amsterdam,Zebra crossings on cycling paths next to intersections with traffic lights: why?,"When I'm cycling, I usually yield to pedetrians (or try to, at least; they often don't go). The one situation in which I usually don't is if I'm on an intersection where the bike and car traffic is regulated with traffic lights, but then the cycling path has a zebra crossing, like on the intersection of De Clercqstraat and Bilderijkstraat, or Overtoom and Eerste Constantijn Huygensstraat.

You've been waiting for the light to turn green, you cross the intersection, and then as soon as you're on the other side there's a zebra crossing. Not only is it frustrating to have to slow down after you've just picked up speed, it's often so busy that if you were to yield, all the cyclists behind you would be stuck on the road (or crash into you). It just makes no sense to have zebra crossings here.

bicycling,I was hit by a car. Is it my fault? Do you have any advice?,"Today, I was involved in a minor collision while riding my Class 2 e-bike. I was traveling at around 20 mph in a designated bike lane, heading straight with the intersection approximately 100 feet ahead. I typically begin to slow down when I get within 30 to 40 feet of the intersection, but at the time of the incident, I was still maintaining my top speed.

The traffic in the car lane next to me was heavy. A white SUV, which was about 50 feet from the intersection, attempted to bypass the congestion by cutting through a parking lot that runs alongside the bike lane. As I tried to avoid the collision, I swerved my handlebars toward the pedestrian walkway. Unfortunately, the SUV’s front bumper struck my hip during the maneuver.

I suspect the driver failed to check their side mirror or blind spot. I called the police and filed a report, but the officer said they couldn’t determine who was at fault due to the lack of witnesses or surveillance cameras.

I went to urgent care, got an X-ray, and fortunately, I only have a bad bruise on my hip. I haven’t been able to inspect my bike yet due to my limited mobility, but the car didn’t appear to have any visible damage.

I’m hesitant to hire an attorney since the police report didn’t clearly assign fault. I understand that if I win a case against the driver or their insurance, my medical and other expenses would be covered. However, if I lose, I’d be responsible for all legal costs.

I'm located in California. Do you have any advice on how to proceed?

Amsterdam,"Maniac with a hammer chased me in Amsterdam, police refused to help","Yesterday I moved into a new apartment in Amsterdam (July 25th). Today, I was walking home from the supermarket, talking on the phone in English, carrying a bag of groceries.

Out of nowhere, a guy on a fatbike started yelling at me in Dutch. I ignored him. Then he circled back, rode towards me, and started screaming in Spanish and English: “Hijo de puta,” “homosexual,” “I’m going to kill you,” “Suriname,” “Dominican Republic,” “I’ll kill you, hijo de puta, call the police come on motherfucker”

I’m Argentine. I wasn’t doing anything, just walking home talking on the phone. Then I saw he had a hammer in his hand.

I asked a nearby man, “Hey, can you help me? This guy has a hammer.” The guy said, “No, fight him.” I replied, “I don’t want to fight, I’m tired.” He kept pushing me to fight. I said, “If he comes close, I’ll defend myself,” and he said, “Alright, I’ll help you.”

Luckily, nothing happened in the end. But it easily could have.

I went straight to the police station. And it was a disaster.

They kept giving me different excuses for not helping me:

•	⁠First, the policewoman said the attack happened in another district (Venserpolder), so I should go there.
•	⁠Then she said they couldn’t believe me because I had no “proof.”
•	⁠Then she said they were too busy to help right now. -Then she said they could file a report, but wouldn’t give me a copy or any proof of it.
•	⁠Finally, the officer, clearly annoyed, told me:

“We’re extremely busy, if you want to open a real investigation, I can give you an appointment in one week, it takes 1.5 hours.”

So that’s what I had to do. I scheduled it. But it’s completely useless for my current situation.

The thing is: I had just moved into a new apartment through HousingAnywhere. They give you 48 hours to cancel and request a refund if there’s a safety issue. But they require a police report as proof.

Now I can’t get one on time, not because the attack didn’t happen but because the police refused to help.

So I left the apartment. I’m staying in a hotel again.

And I’ll probably lose the first month’s rent because no one in authority wanted to take 10 minutes to write a report, even just a note , despite me being almost attacked with a hammer in broad daylight.

Amsterdam looks beautiful, but this experience has made me feel completely unsafe and abandoned.

This city needs to do better.

cycling,Bike collision on cycle path,"Hi everyone, I need some advice.

I was riding downhill on a separated cycle path (pedestrian lane + bike lane). I was in my lane on the right and braking, around **25km/h** at impact. A girl, who was behind two friends on the pedestrian side, suddenly moved into the bike lane and we collided.

Result: my bike frame snapped (I still have it), I got small cuts. She and her bike were fine.

I tried contacting her later asking if she could contribute to repair costs (the bike was bought with my summer savings), but I got no answer. One of her friends instead got hostile, refused to share details, and said he’ll “wait for a summons.”

**Evidence I have:**

* Photos of my broken frame.
* Video of her undamaged bike right after the crash.
* Neutral witness: confirms I was in my lane at impact, saw her behind her two friends.
* My friend: says he also had to swerve because she was going against the flow.

I can’t afford a lawyer or repairs on my own. What’s the most realistic step I can take here?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/1nmskzo/bike_collision_on_cycle_path/,1758462852.0,28,bike lane Amsterdam,search,2025-09-21 13:54:12,11,3.0,2.0,11
Amsterdam,"Beautiful city, but the public cannabis use is hard to ignore as a tourist","Hey Amsterdam folks and fellow travelers,

Just finished my first full week in Amsterdam and wanted to say: what an incredible city. The canals, the bikes, the architecture, the culture… it's all been amazing. Thanks for the hospitality!

That said, I wanted to share one thing that really stood out (and not in a good way): the frequent smell and use of cannabis in very public places. I'm not talking about the Red Light District at night (which is kind of expected), but early mornings outside places like the opera house, near restaurants, shops, or even hotel entrances. It caught me off guard and honestly made certain experiences less enjoyable.

I completely respect that Amsterdam has a different attitude toward cannabis than many places, and I'm not trying to tell locals how to live, but for a tourist trying to enjoy a morning walk or a quiet coffee by the canals, it can feel overwhelming at times.

Just thought I'd share a visitor's perspective.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amsterdam/comments/1ly9ka5/beautiful_city_but_the_public_cannabis_use_is/,1752350293.0,46,Amsterdam bike,search,2025-07-12 19:58:13,11,3.0,2.0,11
bikecommuting,Bike Rush Hour,"Who here has experienced bike rush hour? I'm talking about 7am in Amsterdam or Copenhagen when everyone is biking to work. In my city in the US (Grand Rapids, MI) I'm lucky that most of my commute is along protected/dedicated bike paths where cyclists are few and far between. This allows me to safely move as fast as I can make my bike go and I only have to keep a lookout for vehicles and pedestrians.

How big of a nuisance is rush hour?

Does it slow you down?

What speed does bike traffic generally move at during rush hour?

Has anyone witnessed cyclist-cyclist disagreements/ road rage due to lack of space?

bikecommuting,Got called a slur while biking home from work,"Yesterday I was on my daily bike commute back home, for reference, I work at a university in the middle of a small city. My route home goes through some city streets before turning on to a bike lane for almost the entirety of the rest of the way. I was on this small city street section going in between some construction which had made it one lane at that point. During this section I can keep up with the cars (even on my normal non electric bike) with not much issue as they don’t go that fast through the stop lights and traffic and construction. But here I was, minding my own business keeping up with the car ahead of me right before my turn and this motorcycle guy on his big Harley Davidson (tm) is tailgating me pretty hard and clearly trying to bother me. I just ignore him and start my left turn onto my bike lane street and as I do, he screams out at me “get the fuck out of the way ponytail faggot”. To me, I found it quite humorous and just kept going. I was wearing the most cis het outfit ever, my school branded polo, khaki pants, and my backpack and helmet. So the fact that he thinks to say that just because I have my hair in a ponytail? Quite amusing. I do have very pretty long hair, but I do try to keep it in a ponytail to avoid getting it in my face. I’d have to assume he was just annoyed that the streets are allowed to be used by bicycles and anything other than his Harley Davidson (tm) motorcycle. But that’s that, that’s my story of the day. How would you have handled it? Done anything differently? I feel lucky he didn’t try to clip my wheel with his motorcycle or get physical as he sounded very agitated.

Amsterdam,Got threatened by an aggressive taxi driver in Amsterdam today—what the hell is wrong with people?,"Today I had a terrifying experience while biking in the center of Amsterdam. A taxi driver tried to drop off passengers directly in the middle of the bike lane. I tried my best not to hit the people getting out, but the taxi was literally blocking the entire lane. In the chaos, I ended up hitting his mirror.

Instead of realizing he was the one causing a dangerous situation, the driver sped up, blocked my way, and started threatening me, demanding I pay him 50 euros. He was yelling and acting super aggressively—honestly, it felt like he was on something. It wasn’t just anger—it was unhinged.

Luckily, a few people nearby stepped in and protected me, which probably made him back off. He eventually drove away, still furious. But I was genuinely shaken. I’ve been biking here for a while and I know the city can be chaotic, but this felt next-level unsafe.

Amsterdam,Help (Re)-Learning How to Cycle,"Hello!

I arrived in Amsterdam earlier this week and turns out the saying “just like riding a bike” doesn’t apply to me. Perhaps I didn’t learn all the fundamentals when I was young but it felt like I’d never been on a bike before and cycling back home on the Swapfiets I overconfidently rented was harrowing to say the least.

I’ve gone through old posts here where people have asked the same question and I’ve gotten some great tips I’ll be implementing - working on balance, practicing in a park etc. 

What I’m really after though is a teacher. I know myself and I learn far better if I can ask questions and there’s someone I can talk to. I’ve contacted Jimmy from Koala Bike Lessons and he only has availability in June and so far, community centers have lessons at times that don’t work for someone with a job. Does anyone know another private teacher or would be willing to give me some lessons that could start asap? I really feel I’d be missing out lots if I don’t learn to cycle. 

I’m based in Westerpark, super close to the park.

Netherlands,Assaulted by Tourist while Cycling,"I was riding my bicycle on Amstel, this morning (3.30) on my way back home. 

Directly in front of the XtraCold Icebar Amsterdam, a drunk Spanish male tourist suddenly jumped from the footpath into the street and deliberately pushed me while I was cycling. I managed to keep my stability on the bike, but it was a dangerous and deliberate action that could have caused harm. 

After pushing me, the tourist crossed the streets, mocking me and blew a raspberry in a clearly manner. I yelled and cursed him, cameras are everywhere in that area, and there were a lot of people, including the guys with the yellow jackets for the traffic. 

The tourist didn't stop and, together with his group (3 or 4 males plus 3 or 4 girls), crossed the Blauwbrug. 

I waited 1 minute, and when I got back to myself, I followed them. For the first 10 minutes, they clearly tried to ignore me. He avoided at all costs looking in my direction. Only the girl with him checked my position multiple times porque ella tiene mas pelotas que el cobarde. 

I stopped to follow them in front of the Scheepvaartmuseum.

Netherlands,Swapfiets e-bike - Yes or No?,"Hey everyone!  
I recently secured an internship in Amsterdam. The office is, however, 9.3km away and thus a 35 minute bike ride. I could also take the metro from zuid to Centraal but realistically there's no way I will pay the bike supplement 4/5 days of the week. That being said, it would be a matter of when I get fined, not if.

The company offers me 20 euros worth of SwapFiets subscription. I can choose whichever package. Thus I am torn between 2 options: the premium standard bike (with 7 gears, cheaper if it gets stolen) that would thus be free, or the E-bike model 1 which would bring me to 25 Euros/month. However, the costs of the repairs in case of the battery damage or theft are scary af.

Netherlands,Moved to the Netherlands with high hopes — now questioning if I should stay,"I'm a 33F who lived in Brazil my whole life until recently. I also hold EU citizenship, and a small part of my family lives in Europe (my parents even lived there for a few years to study and work). Moving abroad has been a dream since I was a kid, but I never had the financial means to do it.

In 2019, I finally had a bit saved up and spent a month in Denmark doing volunteer work, just to see how it would feel. It was amazing, but of course, it was summer, and everything feels different when you know you have a return ticket. After that, I applied for a master’s program in Denmark, got accepted… and then COVID hit. It felt too risky, so I ended up taking my degree in my home country instead, since I had also been accepted into a university there.

During my master’s, I joined a mobility program and spent 3 months in Ireland doing research. I didn’t love the weather, and honestly, the large number of Brazilians (some of whom have faced attacks from fascist groups) made me question whether it would be a place I’d want to settle in.

I was only able to revisit my plan after finishing my master’s in January 2024. After researching different countries, the Netherlands seemed like a good fit. High salaries, the possibility of getting by in English, and milder winters compared to Denmark. Lastly, a friend offered me a place to stay during my first months. So I quit my job in Brazil on good terms (they even said I could return anytime) and moved to the Netherlands in August 2024.

Since then, I've been living between Utrecht and Amsterdam. I've never been picky about work. I go all in and do what it takes. I’ve worked in catering, as a barista, and as a salesperson. My body has never been so exhausted, but I pushed through. It hasn't been easy emotionally, though.

That said, this is not the life I envision long-term. I may not have earned a fortune in Brazil, but I had a stable and decent life. I’m qualified and respected there. The thing is, I have a background in Humanities (a bachelor’s in Law and a master’s in Communication), which isn’t really an area in high demand - anywhere really.

I do have over a decade of experience in educational companies, including a brief time in project management. I also ran small businesses, which gave me freedom and valuable skills. I'm a photographer and have worked with social media content as well.

I’m fluent in English, have beginner-level German, and have recently started learning Dutch.

But here’s my big question: **Is it truly possible to build a decent life here with this background?** I don’t mean just surviving. I want comfort and quality of life at some point.

The housing crisis hit me hard. I know it’s a problem everywhere, and of course, I was aware of it before coming, but experiencing it first-hand while juggling physically demanding jobs left me anxious and depressed. It even affected a relationship I had just started: my boyfriend ended up replacing me (shitty move, yes) probably because my mood was so low right after I moved to his city and started back from zero (again, third time within 7 months).

So now I wonder: **Is it still smart to pursue this dream of living in the Netherlands? Or anywhere in Europe, really?**

I constantly consider switching careers and moving away from academia into something more corporate. Maybe investing in project management, or something in marketing. **But is that realistic? Would studying and applying for these paths really lead to a better life here?**

Mind you, I left Brazil partly because of financial struggles (you have to work a lot to earn the minimum, but I do have my own apartment there, for example), but also because I’ve been a victim of urban violence far too many times.

Still, I love my country. The food is amazing, the people are kind, and there is a true sense of community that I have never seen anywhere in Europe.

So far, I haven't lost any money, but I'm exhausted and my confidence is below zero. I don’t want to give up, but I also want to be honest with myself...

**I’m open to any advice. What would you tell me?**



***UPDATE 1:*** *Some people are assuming I'm asking whether I can make a living in these cities on minimum wage, but that's not what I mean. I've taken these types of jobs so far because they were the only ones I could find to get started while I’m still learning the language and getting acquainted with the culture and weather. But that's not my goal, nor do I believe I can sustain myself forever in the most expensive cities on that kind of pay. My question is whether it's possible to build a career that can support me in the country with my background, because it might not be worth putting all this energy and effort into this difficult expat life if it's not actually going to pay off.*



***UPDATE 2:*** *I ended up coming to Brazil to recharge around loved ones and gain some perspective after my time abroad. I've been reflecting on all of this every day since.*

*I read every comment here (even the stupid ones from incels) and took the (good) advice into consideration — fortunately, most came from kind, well-intentioned people. I really appreciated the encouragement from others in similar situations, but I felt heavy in the messages from people who have already been in the Netherlands for a decade, or who are native Dutch, even, in stable jobs, and who look forward to leaving.*

*Even though I haven't come to a final decision yet, a few points that were raised do resonate with me and reflect some uncomfortable truths:*

* *I certainly don’t (and probably never will) love the things I can’t change: the weather, the language, and the food. So the main things that would keep me in the country are safety and stability, though I’m not even sure the second one truly exists for a person like me.*
* *True community, at least as I understand and value it, will never really happen there. And while I’ve always been more of a loner back home, I still cherish the fact that a good friend is just a phone call away if I need them (and even if I’m distant, I’m never truly forgotten).*
* *Many immigrants who say they’re happy in the Netherlands seem to constantly escape loneliness through money (whether by overconsumption or simply accumulating it) and/or drugs. Those things don’t fulfill me on a deeper level, even though, of course, money is the main issue most times. Honestly, in my experience, some of these people might be the kind who wouldn’t have really “stood out” back home, but who found a sense of identity in being the ""'rich' guy abroad"" (at least among those coming from my country). Still, that feels like a very superficial lifestyle compared to the kind of purpose I want my life to have.*

*I’m starting to feel that, even in the best-case scenario (with a whole lot of money), I still wouldn’t be truly happy in that environment. It reminds me of a sudden click I had when I was preparing for a civil service career in Brazil: the salary was excellent, but I couldn’t picture myself being happy in that path...*

*Like I said before, there’s still no definite decision. I know I’m biased right now by my current shitty situation. I’m exploring the possibility of other countries, as well as the options I might have back home.*  
  
*And I’m not romanticizing anything. Being home and seeing my people again reminded me of the same dissatisfaction that made me leave in the first place: the lack of safety, the feeling of not belonging, and so on. Still, it’s been really good to feel love and warmth again.*

*I appreciate all the attention and positive energy in the replies and messages I received here. There are so many good people in the world... You’ve lit the flame of hope in me again. <3*",295,https://www.reddit.com/r/Netherlands/comments/1ljho41/moved_to_the_netherlands_with_high_hopes_now/,1750786891.0,258,Amsterdam safety,search,2025-06-24 17:41:31,10,0.0,3.0,10
Netherlands,Your experience living in West,"Hi there!

We are a couple in our 30s who want to buy a house in Amsterdam. We saw one just near the Fort Negen bakery, but we are not familiar with the area, so we are looking for some advice.

Currently, we live near Oosterpark, what I did not like in Oost is that it gives Ankara vibes sometimes, and we did not move here for that :)

So my questions are about demographics, safety, diversity, etc.

It would be great to hear your experiences!

**EDIT:**

I see the post get downvoted, and I believe that this is intolerance towards the people who have their opinions about certain things and should be able to freely express themselves.

People making remarks on single girls/women in the park, teenagers riding fat bikes, ppl with tuned VW Golfs making noise with their music set on a high, and so on... Can you guess from where they are coming? I believe you have visualized that yourself. So instead of banning me from Amsterdam (like someone mentioned in the post) it's better for you to start teaching your kids how to behave in Western societies.

I know that troubling people might be 1% of certain ethnic groups, but they came from your families, and almost never will see Western people behaving like that.

Netherlands,Company doing Neighbor's Renovation follows no Health and Safety rules,"Hi Everyone,

I'm in a bit of a situation with my neighbor's ongoing home renovation and could use some advice. For the past three days, I've been dealing with a major issue: the workers have been cutting porcelain tiles in the garden, and the dust is flying everywhere.
For those who don't know, this porcelain dust contains crystalline silica, which is a known carcinogen that can cause severe, permanent lung damage. It's incredibly dangerous for humans and pets, and it's been a nightmare worrying about my family's health.
After a lot of arguing with the owner and the workers, after threatening to call the police, they finally moved the tile cutting indoors. What got to me was the workers' attitude— this guy was in flip-flops and without a shred of proper safety gear, no respirator, no glasses, just kitchen gloves, was cutting the tiles. When i asked him to stop becuase it is dangerous dust flying around. His answer was- ""I work for money not for you. So i am not going to stop or listen to you."" Also added that he only speaks Persian.
On top of this, they have a massive, I think unapproved, trash skip sitting in front of the house since a month, and the public path is constantly covered in construction debris. The skip isn't properly secured, so garbage is often spilling out into the street.
My question is: what is the proper authority in Amsterdam to report this to? I want to make sure this is handled properly so they don't just go to their next job in a few days and the problem is now elsewhere putting someone else health at risk.

Any advice on the correct procedure or who to contact would be a huge help. Thanks!

Amsterdam,Copenhagen is basically an upgraded version of Amsterdam,"I have been living for some time in Copenhagen before coming to live here, and I noticed a lot of similarities. But as time goes by, I am noticing that many things make Copenhagen a better city overall.

First, the housing situation has some similarities, but Copenhagen is still way easier to figure out—and cheaper. Also, the transportation is way more efficient and cheaper as well. In Amsterdam, you pay a shitload of money and after 00:30 there is no more metro, even during the weekend? For a city that is avoiding cars that much, it is crazy to me.

The bike culture is another similarity, but once again, in Copenhagen it is way better organized. As a pedestrian, you don’t fear getting bumped by a bike at every corner.

Copenhagen also doesn’t have that not-so-nice type of tourism coming mainly to get stoned.

On the positive side, grocery shopping is way better and cheaper here in the Netherlands.

But in the end, salaries are higher in Copenhagen than in Amsterdam, with cheaper housing, so I think it balances out.

Amsterdam,Amsterdam is two cities at once,"I recently moved to Amsterdam after spending a few years in Groningen, so I’m still settling in and getting a feel for the city. I've been settling in Oost, quiet streets, familiar faces at the cafés, and that relaxed local rhythm where people actually stop to chat with neighbors or sit outside when the sun finally shows up.

The moment I bike into the center it’s chaos, tourists, stag parties, the same pancake menus everywhere. Then ten minutes later, back in Oost, it feels like a completely different world again

Feels almost surreal that both realities live so close together.   
For those of you who’ve been here longer, how do you balance the two Amsterdams? Do you avoid the center completely, or do you still dip in sometimes for certain spots/events and then retreat back to your own neighborhood bubble?",239,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amsterdam/comments/1mvcolg/amsterdam_is_two_cities_at_once/,1755690909.0,125,Amsterdam bike,search,2025-08-20 11:55:09,9,3.0,2.0,9

Amsterdam,Experience with taxi prices once public transport stops running on NYE tomorrow,"Due to needing to be in 2 or possibly 3 places tomorrow in Amsterdam for NY, each within 2-3km of each other, I'm wondering how can I best plan for that. I live just outside of Amsterdam but not within biking distance. I also have a car but I really wouldn't know where to leave it in order to not stress about it being damaged by fireworks or idiots.

A couple of months back, on a Friday night around midnight, I was with a friend that was too drunk to walk, in Badhoevedorp. My car was parked 2km away, but she was walking so slow that I was losing my mind, so I looked for a taxi. After getting rejected by 10 different drivers on both Bolt and Uber, I ended up paying 36E for a 3 min taxi ride.

Due to this experience and also keeping into account that tomorrow the wind is going to be less than friendly, I'm thinking that getting a car with ShareNow will be quite difficult.

Demand will be quite high tomorrow, does anyone have experience with prices from last year for a 2-3 km ride close to midnight? I don't know of any price ceiling imposed by Uber or Bolt, and I know that drivers know how to make the dynamic pricing work in their favor.

Amsterdam,Company doing Neighbor's Renovation follows no Health and Safety rules,"Hi Everyone,

I'm in a bit of a situation with my neighbor's ongoing home renovation and could use some advice. For the past three days, I've been dealing with a major issue: the workers have been cutting porcelain tiles in the garden, and the dust is flying everywhere.
For those who don't know, this porcelain dust contains crystalline silica, which is a known carcinogen that can cause severe, permanent lung damage. It's incredibly dangerous for humans and pets, and it's been a nightmare worrying about my family's health.
After a lot of arguing with the owner and the workers, after threatening to call the police, they finally moved the tile cutting indoors. What got to me was the workers' attitude— this guy was in flip-flops and without a shred of proper safety gear, no respirator, no glasses, just kitchen gloves, was cutting the tiles. When i asked him to stop becuase it is dangerous dust flying around. His answer was- ""I work for money not for you. So i am not going to stop or listen to you."" Also added that he only speaks Persian.
On top of this, they have a massive, I think unapproved, trash skip sitting in front of the house since a month, and the public path is constantly covered in construction debris. The skip isn't properly secured, so garbage is often spilling out into the street.
My question is: what is the proper authority in Amsterdam to report this to? I want to make sure this is handled properly so they don't just go to their next job in a few days and the problem is now elsewhere putting someone else health at risk.

Any advice on the correct procedure or who to contact would be a huge help. Thanks!

Netherlands,Appreciation post for the Netherlands 🙌🏻,"
Hello everyone,
I’ve been living in the Netherlands for a while now, and every now and then I’m struck by how genuinely great this country is.

This isn’t a post about problems or everyday struggles — those exist everywhere. Yes, there are ups and downs, but in my honest opinion, the positives of living in the Netherlands far outweigh the negatives. I felt the need to share this because sometimes when you scroll through Reddit, it seems like it’s all complaints and frustrations. So here’s something on the brighter side.

For context: I’ve lived in three or four different countries before settling here, so I feel I have a decent basis for comparison — and the Netherlands really stands out in many ways.

Here are a few things I really appreciate:

1. Warmth and respect
First and foremost, I’ve never experienced hate, judgmental looks, or unpleasant behavior because of my background. Even though I’m not ethnically Dutch, I’ve always felt accepted and treated with respect — and that means a lot.

2. Bikes > Cars
The biking infrastructure is next-level — safe, convenient, and often faster than driving in the cities. I never imagined I’d be the kind of person who bikes in the rain, but here I am… and I actually enjoy it. Fun fact: I’d never even owned a bike before moving here. For the first two years, I resisted getting one. Now I’m pedaling everywhere.

3. Directness in communication
Some see it as blunt, but I really appreciate how people here say what they mean without sugarcoating. It’s honest, efficient, and refreshing — you always know where you stand.

4. Work-life balance
There’s a strong culture of not overworking. People take their vacation seriously, and leaving the office on time is completely normal — not something you have to justify or feel guilty about.

5. Beautiful cities and nature
From the cozy charm of Utrecht and the unique vibe of Amsterdam to the peaceful dunes and coastal villages — the whole country just feels… pleasant. It honestly doesn’t matter where you go; it always feels great to walk around and take it in.

6. Multilingual kindness
Nearly everyone speaks English fluently, but they truly appreciate it when you try to speak Dutch. Even if you completely butcher a sentence, people are usually kind, patient, and happy to help. As an expat, I really want to integrate — and I’m trying to learn the language — but as we all know, saying it is easier than doing it!

7. Stroopwafels and kaas
Need I say more?


Just wanted to show some appreciation for a country that gets a lot of things right — both big and small. Anyone else have something they love about living here?",543,https://www.reddit.com/r/Netherlands/comments/1k2f2ae/appreciation_post_for_the_netherlands/,1745008825.0,104,Amsterdam bike,search,2025-04-18 20:40:25,9,0.0,2.0,9
Netherlands,"Being Threatened by a Homeless Man Staying Illegally in My Neighbor’s Apartment – What Can I Do? (Netherlands, Social Housing)","
Hello everyone,
I’m currently living in a social housing apartment in Amsterdam and would like to share a serious situation I’m dealing with. I’d appreciate any legal advice or suggestions.

There is a tenant living (70years old) upstairs who constantly invites homeless people into his apartment. They often stay for long terms. These individuals use drugs and, disturbingly, the tenant provides his apartment for prostitution. On several occasions, he has brought homeless women from the streets and offered to others in exchange for money. Their conversations echo through the building, and the situation has become very disturbing and unsafe.

Due to my physical disability, I already feel vulnerable. Today, one of the homeless men staying (illegally) in that apartment for 5 years (a Polish man, approximately 35 years old) hit my arm while I was closing the front door and demanded I open it for him. I refused, telling him I didn’t have key. He pushed my arm again, saying, “I told you to open the door.”

This same individual is banned from entering the building because last year, he stole the keys and illegally entered the apartment of our 84-year-old neighbor on the third floor. That neighbor filed a complaint with both the police and the housing company. A nearby neighbor also told me that whenever this man is seen in the building, the police should be called immediately. Despite this, he continues to stay here regularly with the upstairs tenant. Neighbors in building have also reported him to both the police and the housing company, but nothing seems to happen.

Today, while I was closing the building’s front door, he suddenly appeared again. I repeated that I didn’t have my key. He responded aggressively, pushed my arm, and demanded again that I open the door. A moment later, the upstairs tenant (the one who houses him) came down and opened the door. The homeless man then threatened me, saying, “I’ll kill you! I know where you live!” He hit me on the shoulder and spat at me.

I immediately went downstairs and called the police. While I was on the phone with them, he came at me and my spouse with a pair of scissors in his hand and tried to attack us. Had we not defended ourselves, we could have been seriously harmed.

Afterward, he pointed at our apartment and repeated his threat: “I know where you live. I’ll kill you.” He then got on his bike and left. The police arrived just 2 minutes later. They knocked on the door of the apartment where the man had been staying, but another homeless man answered the door instead of the tenant. When the officers asked who the attacker was, he simply replied “Polish,” said he didn’t know him, and added, “I’m not the tenant.”

The police then told me they would inform the neighborhood officer. I expressed concern that the man might come back and harm us. Unfortunately, the police said that although his behavior is criminal, it’s considered a “low-level offense” and there’s not much they can do unless something more serious happens.

I asked them: “So if I get seriously hurt or have to defend myself and hurt him, will that finally be a high-level crime?” They responded that unfortunately, a more serious incident is required before they can take action. They said the neighborhood officer will contact me for follow-up.

When I asked what would happen if he came back in an hour and attacked me again, they told me to call the police again. I asked, “But if you don’t take action, what good will it do to call again?” They said: “Unless there’s something serious, we cannot do anything. The tenant is allowed to invite guests into his home.”

I responded, “Of course he can invite guests, but not to commit criminal acts. And in social housing, only the registered tenant is allowed to live there. Long-term stays, cohabitation, subletting, and regularly hosting homeless people are prohibited unless authorized. Social housing is for personal use only.”

They advised me to contact the housing corporation, they also said they couldn’t control him and he is allowed to invite people in his house and they don’t want to understand.

So my questions are:
	1- What can be done to protect ourselves before something worse happens?

      2- Are there any legal steps we can take against the tenant or the attacker?

      3- Can we push the housing corporation to take action based on the misuse of the apartment?

	4- What kind of self-defense item is legal to carry in the Netherlands for protection purposes?

       5- Is there any way to forcefully remove the homeless man from the building since he is banned and has a history of illegal activity?

We are genuinely scared for our safety and being regularly threatened.

Thank you in advance for any help or advice.

Edit: I found out that “TIW Defence Spray” is not illegal, so I bought it.

Edit 2: Thanks for all the comments. I couldn’t respond to everyone, but I really appreciate your input.

All of the neighbors in the building are over 70 years old, while my wife and I are in our early 30s. And all of them are complaining about him. Our next-door neighbor has known this tenant for 25 years. She told me that during those years, the tenant (who lives above us) used his wife for illegal prostitution, sold drugs, and always found ways to earn money from others without working. Both he and his wife were addicted to substances. His wife passed away last year.

For many years, the situation wasn’t this serious, but now it has escalated. Many people come to his social apartment and stay for long periods, one of them has been living there for 4–5 years.

My next door neighbor also told me that the housing company is planning to install cameras in the building to monitor the situation. However, she said that wouldn’t really prove anything, since it wouldn’t show what’s happening inside the apartment. She said she would contact the manager of the housing company to ask what exactly needs to happen before they take serious action.

Yesterday, the police didn’t file any report, but today I will file a complaint online with both the police and the housing company. The wijkagent still hasn’t called me.

Edit 3:
Today, we went to the police station to request a copy of the crime report that wasn’t given to us yesterday. However, they told us that no official crime report was filed. There is only a kind of complaint recorded in their system, but they couldn’t print it out or proceed with filing it because they consider the incident too minor to take further action.

Our wijkagent (neighborhood officer) was also present, and we met her for the first time. She told us that she is aware of the situation and promised to speak with the tenant who has been inviting homeless people into the building. She said she would inform the housing company and the gemeente (municipality), as this behavior is not normal and action should be taken before things escalate further. She also recommended calling the police immediately if anything happens again, so they can witness the situation directly. She explained that there has been a note on the address in their system for years, and when we call, they will be able to see the ongoing issues associated with it.

bikecommuting,Broke my arm on my commuter…..,"And aside from the obvious frustrations relating to work and household tasks that are way more difficult now, my biggest peeve about the situation is not being able to bike until the cast comes off. 

I’ll be honest, I was riding irresponsibly fast. I was going downhill on my commuter bike (7-speed ebike) on a leisure ride in a park’s bike trail near me. Despite the posted warnings about steep drop offs, I was continuing to peddle while going downhill and gaining speed beyond the posted recommendation. The trail started to curve, and I was too preoccupied with my map to notice a pothole. I tried to brake but I still went flying downhill off the paved track and landed on my elbow. Complex dislocation of the humerus and broken elbow… on my dominant arm to boot… But I remain grateful that I got off so easily for that and that I was wearing my helmet. And thank god there was a passerby near enough to witness this and help me pull the bike off from on top of me while I waited for a ride to the ER!

Amsterdam,2 explosions in 2 weeks on my street,"So, last week there was an explosion just two houses down from us. We heard a loud bang at around 1 in the morning accompanied by considerable amount of flames. At first, I thought it might have been a malfunctioning e-bike battery type of explosion or some sort, but soon I learned it was a deliberate act.

Then just last night, barely a week later, around the same time, we were awoken again by another loud bang. This time it was about five houses away, but still on the same street. Yet another explosion. The damage seemed less severe, but it was still unsettling.

I’m relatively new to Amsterdam (moved here about 3 years ago), and I honestly never expected to experience something like this in the Netherlands. I was warned about the weather and the food, but never about explosions! What's concerning is that after doing a bit of digging online, I found that explosions like these aren't rare here. And honestly, that’s terrifying.

What also surprised me, aside from the explosions themselves, was the way the authorities handled the situation. From what I saw, the police showed up mainly to escort the firefighters, and once the fire was out, they left the scene. No visible follow-up, no police presence, no taped-off area.

Just wanted to be clear - I’m not saying the police aren’t doing their job or that they should do what I’m used to. It's just an observation. I don’t claim to know how these situations are normally or should be  handled here. But where I’m from (where explosions have also happened), the area would typically be cordoned off, guarded overnight, and thoroughly investigated before being cleared. At the very least, they’d make it clear, both to the public and to whoever might be behind it that they’re taking it seriously.

Anyway, I really hope something can and will be done to prevent this from happening again and again. Apologies if this post comes off as too negative - I just wanted to share my experience and thoughts.

Netherlands,"Bought a e-bike ( fat tires) 3 years ago in a shop in Amsterdam , realizing now it’s illegal in  Netherlands.","Hi all! 

About 3 years ago I bought a fat-tire e-bike from a shop here in the Netherlands. I wasn’t aware back then that it had a throttle (so I can ride without pedaling) or that it could go above 35 km/h. I’ve been riding it responsibly, but only recently I found out that both of these things make it illegal as a normal e-bike here.

It feels a bit unfair as I spent nearly €2000 on it, bought it from a legit shop,located in Amsterdam - but now everytime I ride it ( I commute daily with it to work ) I feel a bit scared that the police is gonna stop me and fine me.

So now I’m wondering:
	•	Do people actually get stopped/fined for this?
	•	Can I get the bike modified so it complies with the 25 km/h pedal-assist-only rules?
	•	Or do I have to somehow register it as a moped/scooter to be safe? ( if this option is a thing, then I would prefer doing so) 

Has anyone else run into this situation? Would love to hear what you did.

Amsterdam,Is there any safe way of storing race bikes outdoors?,"I’m the chair of our VVE (homeowners association) and I’m trying to deal with a complaint I don’t really have expertise in: race bikes.

In two of our stairways, the top-floor tenants own expensive racing bikes. Since these are Amsterdam-style narrow staircases, every time they carry the bikes up and down, the tires hit the walls. Over time, the white walls have turned black from the marks.

It honestly looks bad, and I do understand why neighbors are complaining. The majority of members want to forbid bringing bikes through the stairways, but I’d like to find a solution instead of just banning it outright.

I get super nervous driving around in Amsterdam with all the bikes and trams and I don't even want to think about parking my car alongside the road or in a garage. Parking close to a canal is my worst nightmare, and that is where I live. I've been avoiding driving for a long time, but I want to get rid of my anxiety and enjoy the freedom of driving a car.

Amsterdam,Strange encounter on a Friday night,"Throwaway account. Last week, I was visiting my partner that is doing her Master’s in Amsterdam (we’re both females). We went to Albert Heijn (Jan de Jonghstraat) to get some groceries at around 9PM but got stopped by a group of seven young men on the way back. 

They asked us if we can call the police because there is a fight going on nearby. I saw some of them laughing and also holding smartphones in their hands so I said no, and told them to get the police themselves. They were quite adamant and did not want to let us go (held our bikes by force). 

We did not speak Dutch and they kept asking where we’re from — I was already feeling uncomfortable so I said I was not going to tell them. They surrounded us and wanted to see our groceries. I told them to let us go and they said they will, but still held our bikes. In the end, one of them said “yeah, just go. This is my neighbourhood, so just fucking go, otherwise I will fucking shoot you”. So we left while they all continued laughing. 

We did not call the police as realistically nothing really happened and we were also in a shock. The whole thing lasted probably only like three minutes but it just left a really bad feeling in me as this had never happened to me before. I know that we might just have been unlucky, but I do worry that this, or something worse might happen to my partner when she’ll be alone in that area. I guess I just wanted to vent here, but if anyone has any advice as to what do to in such a situation, please let us know too.

bikecommuting,"Newbie cyclist in Zürich here, bike umbrella okay or nah??","Hoi zäme,

So, I’m kinda new with this whole city biking thing. Just got myself a second-hand e-bike here in Zürich, and already realised rain is basically every second day, ja. Commute to work every morning and my old jacket plus umbrella combo is useless. I actually thought there was nothing I could do to stop the experience for now, but while I was scrolling online, I found these “bike umbrella” things on Alibaba. Basically a canopy you clamp to the handlebars, keeps you dry when it pours. Looks clever in the picture, but honestly I don’t trust it, ja.

My buddy already laughed said I’ll fly away like Mary Poppins the first windy day on the lake. And the Föhn can get crazy, eh. But still, commuting every morning to work in the Regen is not so sexy. Poncho makes me schwitzen like crazy, normal umbrella in hand is just gopferdammi impossible while riding.

So my questions, anyone in CH actually tried one of these umbrellas?  How safe is it when the Föhn wind kicks in?  Is it better to just pay for proper rain gear from a local shop instead of cheap online gadget?

I don’t need to look cool, eh, just want to get to work without being soaked like a dumpling. If anyone has experience with these bike umbrellas, please tell me.

urbanplanning,Why has the U.S. buried so many of its historic rivers and creeks?,"
Why did so many cities bury their rivers rather than integrate them into urban design, especially given their ecological, commerce, and historical significance? Who would destroy a source of fresh water? 

I’ve been reading about the history of rivers in American cities and it’s astonishing how many of them were covered or diverted out of sight. In places like Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Detroit, most of the original streams no longer exist above ground. I read somewhere two-thirds of Baltimore’s streams are buried, nearly three-quarters of Philadelphia’s, and more than eighty percent of Detroit’s stream channels have disappeared since the early 1900s. In Washington D.C., only about thirty percent of historic streams are still visible today.

Why?

NYC follows a similar pattern 19th century maps show dozens of small rivers and creeks flowing across Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens. Minetta Creek once ran through Greenwich Village, Sunswick Creek crossed what is now Long Island City, and Wallabout Brook emptied into the East River. All of them were buried by the late nineteenth or early twentieth century as the city expanded. Engineers still use the famous 1874 Viele Map to trace the courses of these hidden waters.

Other cities followed similar paths. Hartford’s Park River, often called the “Hog River,” was gradually entombed in massive concrete tunnels between the 1940s and 1980s after decades of pollution and floods. Philadelphia had several creeks that met the same fate, including Dock Creek and Cohocksink Creek, which were converted into sewers in the nineteenth century. In Yonkers, the Saw Mill River was hidden under downtown until a daylighting project recently restored sections of it above ground, showing how revival is possible even after decades underground.

Looking at this history makes me wonder: why did so many American cities choose to bury their waterways instead of incorporating them into urban design? Was it mainly about flood control, sanitation, and public health, or was it more about making room for development?",160,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/1n2nq5j/why_has_the_us_buried_so_many_of_its_historic/,1756413874.0,66,fallback_new,fallback,2025-08-28 20:44:34,5,1.0,0.0,5

Are there some specific things to know/do to own and ride a bike here ? apart from A1 license and insurance of course. 

Is there some kind of APK and taxes similar to cars ?

This is the third crash I am involved in the last 13 months.

First one: I lady swerved into me and face planted, Chinese law somehow blamed me 100% since I was 3 k faster than her.

Seconded one: a lady in a Volvo made a right turn and rear ended me when I was going straight and claimed I was insurance frauding.

This one: there were only 2 of us on street and somehow she still tried to cut me from wrong way.

Chinese road is devastating.

Got up not realizing my shoulder (right clavicle) was broken and walked my bike 2 miles home. Was about to have lunch with the wife until she insisted on checking my shoulder...

bicycling,Tariffs Question,"I need to replace a wheel damaged while riding.

The company, located in China, has a crash-replacement policy with a 15% discount.

They quoted me at $300 which includes $110 shipping costs. I asked via email and chat if there will be any tariffs/import fees I'll get charged by UPS (the shipper in this case).

In both the email and chat (which I have saved), they assured me the $300 is the total cost.

With the de minimis no longer applicable, I still have this nagging suspicion UPS will stick me with an additional charge. And, if the charge is ridiculously high, I will have to refuse shipment and still eat the $100 shipping fee. If this is how it plays out, I'm out the $100 and still need a wheel.

Has anyone been in this situation recently? If so, how did it your experience turn out?

Thank you

Edit 1:

Although the majority are convinced I will have to pay some type of tariffs/duty, I placed the order for the replacement wheel.

Here is my reasoning.

The seller is adamant the quoted price is all-inclusive.

If there are additional costs, the seller confirmed they will pay. I plan to hold them to this. If they push back, I will refuse the shipment and request a full refund. If I do not get a full refund, I will file a claim with the entity used for payment. I'm fairly optimistic that any appeal will be ruled in my favor (although this is not guaranteed). All emails and screenshots have been saved.

I don't need another complete wheel set. I only need a new rear wheel. And, although this company makes budget carbon wheels bike snobs will laugh at, I'm very impressed with them. They work, plain and simple.

Furthermore, the customer service contact has been very good - with my original order as well as this current matter. My emails are answered within one business day (time difference factored in).

Undoubtedly, the Negative Nancys and internet morons will down vote and come up with their best acerbic version of ""I told you so"" if this goes sideways. But that's okay. I'm willing to take the risk and live with how it plays out.

urbanplanning,A city without private transport (cars).,"If we imagine a very big city that has a population of 10 million people. Can it sustain itself completely without any kind of private vehicles? Most US cities have high usage of cars, and they are car-centric. If we make a car-banned city, create public transportation infrastructure, trams on every street in the city, and we can create a large system of buses, we can make a beautiful city that doesn't suck. There would be trees encompassing the sidewalks, so that people who are walking can have shade. We might not have the budget to get a tram in the suburbs. So, we can use small [shuttle buses](https://www.alibaba.com/showroom/shuttle-bus.html) to transport people from one place to another. 

Plus, massively expanding the existing metro systems. The metro seats should be sorted like the buses, so that everyone can sit in the metro. There would be high-speed rail encompassing the entire country so that people can travel from one big city to another in a short time. Banning cars might also prevent accidents. 

There would be no need for private transport at all (except bikes). We will transform all the big roads into public city centers. Instead of having big 6-lane roads out of nowhere in the city and a BIG parking lot, we can turn all those roads into beautiful public recreational areas. If you want to drive a car, like if you want to ride a horse, you can go to some tracks, where you can drive your favorite car. 

I don't know if it would be sustainable for small cities to make such a thing, but I think it might be feasible for big cities.
