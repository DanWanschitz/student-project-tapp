Netherlands,So I rented a bike in Amsterdam,"33 EUR well spent with occasional confused looks and nods of approval from the people :D  

Don't ask me ""why"", I just biked cause the routes never stopped...

EDIT: Thanks overall! I did enjoy my trip, and flattered that many worried for my ass... it healed :D

I bookmarked some new places to others' suggestion, and seemingly should have gotten the bike stolen and filed a police report to have full 100% Dutch experience - maybe next time (?!) - I still need to try some other food than oatbars and burgers too.

The `looks and nods` was a light-hearted joke :P

bicycling,hit by a wrong way bike on my first metric century,"A 130 k ride turned into a big crash, a women ride a bike crossing two car lane and accelerated then cutting right in front of me. I ended up fly over the curb and landed on my ribs. CT scan shows no fracture and carbon frame and carbon wheels show no sign of any damage.

This is the third crash I am involved in the last 13 months.

First one: I lady swerved into me and face planted, Chinese law somehow blamed me 100% since I was 3 k faster than her.

Seconded one: a lady in a Volvo made a right turn and rear ended me when I was going straight and claimed I was insurance frauding.

This one: there were only 2 of us on street and somehow she still tried to cut me from wrong way.

Chinese road is devastating.

Amsterdam,Stop being assholes to pregnant people,"I'm 33 weeks pregnant. I'm VISIBILY VERY PREGNANT. And every time I've had to take public transportation there are no seats available for me to sit in, that's fine. I will usually ask someone to move their bag or wait until someone gets off at the next stop. What I'm referring to is people PUSHING and RUSHING past me to run to the open seat before I can even get on the tram/metro. For the past week I've had people cut in front of me while waiting for the metro doors to open to sit in seats and then ignore me when I ask them to move. Some will even push me. Cars will not slow down at zebra crossings when I'm in the middle of walking and then will hard brake so they don't hit me. I've also had people on bikes, cycling on the pavement, yelling and ringing their bells to get me to move. THERE'S A WHOLE BIKE LANE FOR YOU TO CYCLE, I WILL TAKE MY TIME WADDLING BECAUSE I'M CARRYING A WHOLE ASS BABY INSIDE ME. 

I never cared about this stuff before but now that I am pregnant, I see how many assholes there are in Amsterdam. Are there other less-abled people who experience this? Because it is such a poor reflection on our city and its people. 

Edit: A lot of comments about how people should give up seats to the infirmed/elderly/disabled. Yes I agree but that's not my point. In an ideal world this would happen but I know it won't. My point is if someone is walking slowly or has mobility issues, please be more empathetic and not an asshole. The 1 second you save is not worth it. I'm also sorry to everyone else who experienced this. Let's move forward and continue to make the change we want to see!

I think there's plenty of ugly comments in here about how I'm using my pregnancy to get special treatment to prove that our city really does have awful and illiterate people. Do the decent thing and get therapy. ",1014,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amsterdam/comments/1jzyoz2/stop_being_assholes_to_pregnant_people/,1744740349.0,448,Amsterdam cycling,search,2025-04-15 18:05:49

Amsterdam,Amsterdam completely changed how I think about transport,"I come from a very car-centric family in Houston (lots of professional mechanics). Growing up, cars were the most discussed topic in our home. They were seen as a necessity, adult, reliable. Bikes were for kids or for people who couldn’t afford a car. That’s genuinely how I thought for most of my life.

Then I moved to Amsterdam with my kids and everything changed.

Here, bikes aren’t hobbies, they are how people live. You see families everywhere on bikes, parents hauling kids, groceries, even pets. It’s normal. The city is built for it. Dedicated bike lanes, bike traffic lights, actual space to ride safely. Once you get into the rhythm, it just makes sense.

Amsterdam completely changed how I used to think about daily commuting and what little doubt I had left got thrown out thanks to a neighbour who let me try their long cargo bike. A few rides were all it took for me to know this is what I wanted and I have never been happier with a decision in my life. Now I own my very own e-cargo bike (tarran t1 pro). My kid loves it, I love it and honestly, it’s hard to imagine going back.

But recently my family visited and safe to say they were shocked to see this change in my life. To them, relying on an e-cargo bike for everything seemed childish. They still see cars as necessities and couldn't appreciate the value of a bike. A $7,000 cargo bike came across as a luxury to them and a bad financial decision. But these are the same people driving $100,000 cars, paying insurance, fuel, maintenance, parking. Talking with them made me realise that when people buy a car, they mentally discard the cost. With an e-cargo bike, everything’s upfront but it gives back more than you’d expect (no fuel, no traffic, cheap insurance, minimal maintenance). People confuse that upfront cost with long term benefits because they still see bikes as leisure, not tools. And that’s the mindset that really needs to change.

I wanted my kid to have the safest, most comfortable ride possible so I got a bike that could actually handle it. With my oldest being four and my youngest two, I can see myself using this bike for a very long time. I couldn't convince my family that its not a phase I am going through so I thought I would take a moment to thank this city for changing how I move and how I parent.

Anyone else here for whom this city completely changed the way you think about getting around?",668,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amsterdam/comments/1o1hcfl/amsterdam_completely_changed_how_i_think_about/,1759945309.0,183,Amsterdam bike,search,2025-10-08 17:41:49

travel,Destinations where you can do things you can’t do anywhere else?,"My (25M) primary goal of travel is to experience things that I can’t experience anywhere else.

Amsterdam,Racism against Asians in Amsterdam ,"My girlfriend and I, Asian Americans from the Bay Area in the US, are currently on a two week vacation to Europe, having arrived in Amsterdam a few days ago after the German portion of our trip.

While we have enjoyed Amsterdam so far, it seems like there has been some underlying animosity against us based entirely on our ethnicity (Chinese). As we were walking back to our hotel the first night we were here, a man sped by on his bike and yelled “fu*k you China”. Additionally, when we dined at a Dutch fine dining restaurant, it seemed like everyone else around us had been served first even though we had ordered ahead of them from the same set menu (so it wasn’t like we had ordered anything intricate).

Lastly, tonight as we were waking in De Wallen, a teenager/adult side stepped directly in front of me and stared me down. I immediately knew he was looking for trouble and de-escalated by apologizing. As I walked off, he yelled “f*ggot chinaman”.

We had not encountered any sort of direct racism in Germany and having grown up in San Francisco, I had never experienced this level of outward racism before. Are these experiences unique to the Netherlands or just Amsterdam? (considering it is the largest city in the country)

Amsterdam,"If you think about moving to NDSM, think again (or: how the municipality lied and failed NDSM)","**TL;DR:**  
Come live in NDSM-Werf if you hate breathing, are fond of the scent of burning dogpoop or pasta water 24/7, enjoy municipal lies, dislike green spaces, like burning money, and love staying home in solitude (because you can’t get anywhere and your neighbors are moving back to their home country) and stepping in homeless poop first thing in the morning. If you prefer a better quality of living, please stay as far away as possible.

\----------

I live at NDSM-Werf, and I’m furious about the state of affairs. The municipality of Amsterdam hasn’t just failed, it actively seems to make things worse as time goes on.

I’ve lived in other areas of Amsterdam (Reigersbos, nearby Vondelpark, Waterlooplein and Oost) and they were *genuinely* better. NDSM seems promising but is the overpriced ghetto of the future being marketed with sparkles and fairy dust. Let me explain why.

**1. NDSM will literally make you sick (It really smells here!)**

Living in NDSM increases your risk of health issues. According to the [Kankeratlas](https://kankeratlas.iknl.nl/), it’s one of the worst places in Amsterdam in terms of lung cancer risk. Which is something the local residents know all too well as [it has already made them sick and given them lung-issues and asthma.](https://www.trouw.nl/duurzaamheid-economie/last-van-stank-in-amsterdam-dit-kan-niet-goed-zijn~b95a2851/)

What does the municipality do? [They extended the permit of the main polluting factory (ICL) in Amsterdam-West until 2040](https://www.dewestkrant.nl/tegenvaller-woningbouw-haven-stad-kunstmestfabriek-icl-blijft/). That’s 15 more years of increased cancer risk. They don’t care.

Do not be fooled by the built in airfilters. Most appartments have airfilters, but a lot of them do not work against the chemical stench and some have reported that the stench is trapped inside the appartment permanently.

Some quotes from one of the NDSM community whatsapps and groups: 

>*""I've been caughing all night and the stench went through my closed windows and it kept me up. I don't know how I'll be able to work today""*



>*My building is faulty and the smell comes from the airfilters. My neighbors have the same problems. When asking the municipality about this they refer to the GGD - The GGD asked me if I wasn't psychotic as that causes you to smell things too and hung up. The building company, municipality and GGD refuse to help. What can we do now?*



>*I'm working from home but these days its near impossible. I have a splitting headache that has lasted for days.* 



>*I've developed such bad lung issues that I can't work anymore. I've been losing money ever since. I'm scared I need to return to my home country losing everything I've ever worked for.*

**2. They actively hid pollution risks from new residents \[**[**Source: Parool**](https://www.parool.nl/amsterdam/gemeente-verzuimt-bewoners-ndsm-werf-te-informeren-over-vervuiling-we-moeten-onderzoeken-wat-mensen-daar-precies-inademen~bf342d15/) **its** [very](https://www.parool.nl/amsterdam/bewoners-van-noord-zijn-de-stank-van-kunstmestfabriek-icl-beu-het-is-een-verouderde-bende~be61a706/) **easy to find extra sources if this interests you\]**

This one’s wild. In 2008, the municipality made agreements with four heavy polluters (including fertilizer giant ICL and soy processor Bunge) to inform all new residents about the pollution risks in their contracts. This was to manage expectations, prevent complaints and leave the existing industry be.

But never happened.

People moved in for *years* without being warned about the toxic air, the intense smell, or the fact that NDSM is the only inner-city zone *not* considered low-emission. (Except for now but its such a joke when the industry on the other side of the IJ burns your lungs)

Residents now say they can’t even open their windows because of the stench. It seeps through the ventilation systems. Some have developed chronic illnesses on top of the increased cancer risk. And guess what? The municipality *knew*, and chose not to inform anyone.

The municipality admitted their mistake only after residents dug up the original documents through public records requests. Their response? A single letter that basically said “oopsie woopsie sowwy” and a useless “information evening” held during working hours. Thats it. Radio silence again. At the municipality [they keep their findings hidden](https://www.parool.nl/amsterdam/raad-botst-met-wethouder-over-onderzoek-naar-stankoverlast-in-noord-dit-is-echt-onvoldoende~b68441f4/), even if that isn't lawful.

Some homeowners are now considering suing the city for failing to disclose this info before purchase. They can’t cancel their contracts ([even if their homes aren’t built yet)](https://www.trouw.nl/duurzaamheid-economie/tegen-een-ongezonde-fabriekslucht-in-de-buurt-valt-nog-weinig-te-beginnen~bcd1424d/), but they’re rightfully expecting massive devaluation... and cancer.

**3. Accessibility & non-existent parking permits \[**[**Source: Betaald Parkeren Uitbereiden**](https://www.parool.nl/amsterdam/gratis-parkeren-in-amsterdam-ten-einde-vanaf-2026-vrijwel-overal-betalen~b06c11d9/) **and** [**Source: Nieuwbouw geen parkeervergunning**](https://www.parool.nl/nieuws/niet-automatisch-parkeervergunning-bij-nieuwbouw~b4775131/)**\]**

Since 2017, no new car permits have been issued for newly built homes. And guess what—*all* of NDSM was finished after 2017. Your only option? A parking garage at €275/month (!!!), while surrounding neighborhoods pay €70/year for street parking.

There's only one public garage: APCOA NDSM. Homeless people sleep there every night and [frequently break car windows to steal.](https://g.co/kgs/3vAgfTA) Also the moment that nearby factories start to smell, the alarm will go off for hours waking up the entire NDSM-West neighborhood. Why for hours? Because the person who can turn it off has to come from Rotterdam and often doesn't have time. Being eligible for neighborhood-parking prices seems to be a coin-toss and something that is only allowed for the most expensive buildings.

When residents ask the municipality whether this parkingsystem could be reevaluated now that paid street parking has been introduced, we get vague, irrelevant canned responses.  
The answer thats being given to EVERY question stemming from parking in NDSM is:  
*Voor nieuwbouw geldt dat een zogenaamd 0-vergunningplafond wordt ingevoerd. Dit betekent dat geen parkeervergunningen worden verleend. De oorsprong hiervan ligt besloten in de Nota Parkeernormen (2017)*  
Even when its not relevant. Its gross. It feels like the municipality is spitting in your face.

The only real way out of here is the ferry, but that one is very [overcrowded](https://www.at5.nl/nieuws/216706/pont-ndsm-werf-tijdens-spits-overvol-ze-zetten-de-fiets-gewoon-op-je-tenen). The bus company, EBS, is so consistently dysfunctional that both the municipalities of Amsterdam and Zaanstreek have fined them and are [considering terminating their contract](https://www.deorkaan.nl/zaanstad-onderzoekt-intrekking-ov-contract-ebs/). That’s unacceptable in one of the least accessible neighborhoods of the city.

Sure, I’d bike, but that’s not possible without a bridge. [Which isn’t planned in this region.](https://www.amsterdam.nl/projecten/oostbrug/) So... whatever.

Don't be optimistic about this: these (future) apartment blocks don't have enough parking spaces to accommodate the whole building. None of the buildings have that. You'll need to figure something else out with your car or sell it.

**3. The municipality broke its own housing plans \[**[**source: de rekenkamer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL7SVJAGFj8)**\]**

NDSM is ridiculously expensive and only has 20% affordable housing. That wasn’t the original plan.

In 2013, the municipality decided NDSM should be 50% housing, and 50% reserved for communal space, stores, etc. Of that housing, 30% was to be social housing. In 2020, they changed it to 85% housing. Meanwhile, since 2016, Amsterdam’s policy states that 80% of newly built homes should be “affordable” (40% social housing, 40% mid-market), and only 20% “expensive.” NDSM was supposed to be 43% “affordable.”

What did we get? Theres 85% place for housing, and just 15% for communal spaces. Of these houses theres just 20% affordable housing, and the majority of these are temporary (jongerenwoningen and student housing).

[There are no proper parks or other public spaces, only a temporary one.](https://www.at5.nl/nieuws/231775/rekenkamer-waarschuwt-gemeente-voor-onleefbare-nieuwbouwwijken-zorg-voor-sfeer) No schools. A tiny, barebones “tourist Albert Heijn” that seems to ignore standard franchise rules and mostly caters to tourists. Local businesses are frustrated because the municipality refuses to help them find suitable spaces. Because of this the local businesses are slowly being gentrified out and swapped for 8 high-end boutique gyms (I wish that was a joke).

Yes, its possible to go to nearby locations like Zonneplein, but the municipality of Amsterdam has admitted that a healthy local community can only be fostered with strong communal spaces. These spaces do not exist here and will not come here due to lack of budget. The current spaces are very expensive and mostly targeted to tourists or people outside of NDSM.

According to Amsterdam’s own green norms, NDSM-Werf only fulfills *25%* of its green quota. During homesales this *is* being promised for the future though, but theres no budget for it. Or space. Love that for us.

**5. It's tough to build a community when everyone leaves after two years (**[**Rekenkamer warned: NDSM neighborhood is becoming ""unlivable""**](https://www.at5.nl/nieuws/231775/rekenkamer-waarschuwt-gemeente-voor-onleefbare-nieuwbouwwijken-zorg-voor-sfeer)**)**

Because of the inability to breathe, lack of amenities, and sky-high rent, people are angry and leaving fast. Every week you see moving vans and frustrated residents packing up. Almost every renter I talk to is actively looking for a way out. Almost every buyer I spoke to feels scammed and horrified about their purchase.

Most people don’t view their place here as a home but just a temporary pit stop. And that is really leaving its mark on the neighborhood, which is soulless. I’ve even met expats who left the country because NDSM made them fall out of love with Amsterdam.

Oh, and if you’re Dutch: good luck. Everyone assumes you’re an expat. Even the Dutch supermarket staff will speak English to you by default because NDSM feels like it’s 70% expat.

**6. Poor city planning (Windpocalypse)**

The buildings look kinda nice but there was one massive oversight: when the wind blows a little bit, it *really* blows here. During mild autumn storms, residents have to stay home. It gets that bad.

The IJ sends wind straight into NDSM, and the buildings act like giant wind tunnels. Roof tiles fly off. Bricks fall. Entire streets are blocked due to wind damage. And the sand from nearby construction? It gets *everywhere,* but especially right into your eyes. <3

**7. Business diversity is dying**

Why are there 8 gyms? Eight. GYMS. Where did the arcade go? The secondhand shops? Everything that was worth coming for is gone except for NDSM-North. Everything’s being gentrified out. I know its a good look and that NDSM seems hip now, but its depressing.

**8. Homelessness**

This one’s not the municipality’s fault but it’s an issue.

There’s a serious homeless problem here, like in the rest of Amsterdam. Because NDSM is mostly apartments, many homeless people break into building lobbies, sleep under staircases, and sometimes act out violently. I was stalked for weeks by a mentally ill man who broke into a storage unit and lived there. He rang my bell constantly and threatened my neighbor with a knife.

\-----------

I’m furious at the policymakers who are building the ghetto of the future and charging extortionate prices for it. My neighbors agree. It’s heartbreaking. I'd like to move (and most likely outside of Amsterdam), but I'm stuck for 3 more years.

I recently went to the *Stadspaneel Noord* meeting, and they were fully aware of these issues. When asked if there are any short- or long-term solutions, they quietly admitted:  
**“Not really.”**

They *know* this is the next Bijlmer in the 80s. Just with more yuppies and better PR.

\-----------

Edit: I made this post because its impossible to research where you're going to live when you're moving to NDSM, especially when you're not a native dutch speaker. There are barely any reports on the stench, the health effects, you'll need to run postal codes through a special tool to check if you'll get parking privileges (you can't, but you won't find this in your contract or listings). You also can't find anything about wind, the homeless, the vibes or the temporary nature of the residents. All you'll see is glitters, fairydust, how hip it is, and promises made for the future that will inevitably be broken.

The Municipality of Amsterdam has praised NDSM to high heavens but theres 0 reports of what its actually like, especially in english. If you know, you'll gladly stay away. I've spoken to multiple neighbors - plenty of expats and Dutch people - who express their immense dissatisfaction and feel lied to and gaslit and attempt to leave and/or sue.",587,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amsterdam/comments/1jwnznh/if_you_think_about_moving_to_ndsm_think_again_or/,1744372428.0,173,Amsterdam bike,search,2025-04-11 11:53:48
Netherlands,Appreciation post for the Netherlands 🙌🏻,"
Hello everyone,
I’ve been living in the Netherlands for a while now, and every now and then I’m struck by how genuinely great this country is.

This isn’t a post about problems or everyday struggles — those exist everywhere. Yes, there are ups and downs, but in my honest opinion, the positives of living in the Netherlands far outweigh the negatives. I felt the need to share this because sometimes when you scroll through Reddit, it seems like it’s all complaints and frustrations. So here’s something on the brighter side.

For context: I’ve lived in three or four different countries before settling here, so I feel I have a decent basis for comparison — and the Netherlands really stands out in many ways.

Here are a few things I really appreciate:

1. Warmth and respect
First and foremost, I’ve never experienced hate, judgmental looks, or unpleasant behavior because of my background. Even though I’m not ethnically Dutch, I’ve always felt accepted and treated with respect — and that means a lot.

2. Bikes > Cars
The biking infrastructure is next-level — safe, convenient, and often faster than driving in the cities. I never imagined I’d be the kind of person who bikes in the rain, but here I am… and I actually enjoy it. Fun fact: I’d never even owned a bike before moving here. For the first two years, I resisted getting one. Now I’m pedaling everywhere.

3. Directness in communication
Some see it as blunt, but I really appreciate how people here say what they mean without sugarcoating. It’s honest, efficient, and refreshing — you always know where you stand.

4. Work-life balance
There’s a strong culture of not overworking. People take their vacation seriously, and leaving the office on time is completely normal — not something you have to justify or feel guilty about.

5. Beautiful cities and nature
From the cozy charm of Utrecht and the unique vibe of Amsterdam to the peaceful dunes and coastal villages — the whole country just feels… pleasant. It honestly doesn’t matter where you go; it always feels great to walk around and take it in.

6. Multilingual kindness
Nearly everyone speaks English fluently, but they truly appreciate it when you try to speak Dutch. Even if you completely butcher a sentence, people are usually kind, patient, and happy to help. As an expat, I really want to integrate — and I’m trying to learn the language — but as we all know, saying it is easier than doing it!

7. Stroopwafels and kaas
Need I say more?


Just wanted to show some appreciation for a country that gets a lot of things right — both big and small. Anyone else have something they love about living here?",534,https://www.reddit.com/r/Netherlands/comments/1k2f2ae/appreciation_post_for_the_netherlands/,1745008825.0,104,Amsterdam bike,search,2025-04-18 20:40:25

Amsterdam,Pyongyang really is an upgraded version of Amsterdam,"I don’t even know where to begin. I spent two weeks in Pyongyang, and let me tell you: Amsterdam could NEVER.

Let’s start with the streets. In Pyongyang? Immaculate. You could eat off the pavement. Not a single drunk Brit peeing in a canal. Not a single crusty junkie harassing you for change. Just wide boulevards, synchronized traffic, and not a single fucking bicycle in sight. Meanwhile in Amsterdam, if you don’t get mowed down by a fixie-riding finance bro, you’ll be dodging scooters ridden by teenagers live-streaming on TikTok.

Safety? I could leave my bag on a park bench in Pyongyang and come back a week later—still there. Amsterdam? I left my bike for ten minutes and came back to find just the sad remains of a broken lock. Say what you want, but you don’t need ten surveillance cameras per street corner when the entire population’s on the same page.

Don’t even get me started on the people. Polite, well-dressed, not constantly baked out of their minds. No one screaming in English about “muh freedoms” while simultaneously throwing up in a trash can. In Pyongyang, people walk with purpose. In Amsterdam? Everyone’s either a lost tourist, an Instagram influencer, or a 40-year-old man in a Canada Goose jacket yelling “kankerhoer” into his phone.

And the architecture? You ever see Juche Tower? Monumental. Inspiring. Not some crumbling 1600s house-turned-coffee shop with seven shades of mold and a €3000/month rent tag.

Public transport? Timely. Clean. Uniformed attendants. None of that NS bullshit where the train shows up twenty minutes late and then skips your stop entirely because the driver “feels unsafe.”

Honestly, I don’t think I can ever go back to Amsterdam. I’ve seen the light. I’ve tasted true order.

Pyongyang > Amsterdam.

bikecommuting,Am I part of the club now?,"Was commuting home for lunch on my road bike (Cannondale R700) and the wheel got caught between the transition of the grass and curb/road. Was only going maybe 10-12mph but fell squarely on my shoulder on the road. Hit my head on the road too but thankfully always wear my helmet so no damage there. Got up not realizing my shoulder (right clavicle) was broken and walked my bike 2 miles home. Was about to have lunch with the wife until she insisted on checking my shoulder... Needless to say we went straight to the Dr. to get checked out. Won't be able to ride again until 2026. Be careful out there, it doesn't take much!

Amsterdam,Fatbikes in Amsterdam Bos en Lommer and Westerpark,"Hi everyone,

This week, for the second time, I saw two teenage boys riding fatbikes crazy fast through the streets, slapping or grabbing women and girls as they passed by. Each time, the victims were completely caught off guard and clearly shaken. One time I tried to go after them, but on a regular bike there was no way to catch up. At least I showed the woman that someone cared and tried to support her.

What shocked me even more: there were other people around, and no one said or did anything. Why is no one standing up to this kind of behavior?

I have two daughters myself, and I don’t want to live in a world where women have to be afraid just walking down the street. I’ve been living in the Netherlands for 12 years now (I’m a foreigner), and I’ve never seen things like this until the past 2–3 years. It feels like it’s happening more often, and I think these guys need to face some pushback. If not, where does it end?

Curious to hear your thoughts. Anyone else noticing this?",287,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amsterdam/comments/1l46o1f/fatbikes_in_amsterdam_bos_en_lommer_and_westerpark/,1749148014.0,160,Amsterdam bike,search,2025-06-05 18:26:54
bikecommuting,"Lucky to be alive. Beware of train tracks. Wear A Helmet, Be Visible","TLDR : Crashed on train tracks in busy road at night, combination of helmet, bright shirt, attentive drivers and flashing rear light saved my life. Be safe out there, ALWAYS wear a helmet and stay visible (lights, highvis)

Well I had my first crash today after commuting for a couple months. Was riding down a big road (no bike lane) at speed (15-20 mph) at night, and I was distracted by a pickup behind me that appeared to not be paying attention (thankfully they were). It was riding up behind me at speed and not changing lanes. Right after one of these glances over my shoulder to check that car, I looked back ahead and there are tracks. Before I can think my wheel turns and im on the ground. I hear the pickup hit its brakes then speed off, and I get out of the road as fast as I can. Thankfully, I am uninjured besides a sprained toe and lots of little scrapes. The only damage I noticed on my bike was a turned handle bar which I have already corrected. Very scary and i am lucky to be alive and relatively uninjured. Will definately be investing in some mirrors and taking a different route from now on. Im glad I was wearing a helmet, bright shirt, and flashing rear light. They probably saved my life. Be safe out there, ALWAYS wear a helmet and stay visible (lights, highvis).

Amsterdam,Spat on face by kids on Fatbikes,"Around 6pm yesterday I took my bike to go play football around Westerpark.   
  
On the bike lane I see a fat bike with 2 kids coming the wrong way super fast, which made me had to swerve to the right. When the 2 kids pass by me they spat in my face. I stop my bike in complete shock. That's when I see another fat bike with another kid coming a few meters behind. I look at him looking for empathy but he also spits on my face. At this point I was feeling even more in shock and humiliated.   
  
I look to the side and there's an old gentleman who witnessed the whole thing who starts comforting me and say things like ""these kids today are horrible, they have no respect. Im so sorry this happened. they will get theirs eventually"". For context the old gentleman was a dutch man of asian or suriname background. (I say this because I dont want this topic to become a racist topic of ""immigrants are bad"". I'm a immigrant myself and I'm a black european).   
  
On the way back from football I see again 2 kids on fatbikes in the very same road I had the incident and it made me feel scared even though I didnt know if they were the same kids. In that same area I saw a group of police officers and went to speak to them about the incident. The police was very sorry for what happened but at the end just said ""these kids on fatbikes are a bit of ***nuisance***"".  
  
So I came home and tried to have a normal evening but then when I tried to fall sleep I couldn't. Even though my body was tired from the football. In my mind I tried to be sympathetic for the aggressors, tried to find positive ways to spin it, tried to let it go but nothing really worked except putting a podcast to lull me to sleep. I only managed to fall asleep around 5am but kept waking up until now 9am.   
  
Btw also on the way back from football I saw a black lady having a bike accident and I went to help her out. I bring this up because as I went to help her, another guy also came running to help her. And this guy was the same ethnicity as the kids on the fat bikes. He was super caring and I left the black lady to his care. I bring this up, because the point of my post is not about ""race X is bad"" is about trying to understand why kids today are behaving like this. I grew up in school with ""tough kids"" from ""bad neighbourhoods"" but they were never this cold and dismissive of another human being.  
  
At the end of the day I feel really sad, angry and powerless because it was such a cowardly assault. I can still feel the hot saliva on my face even though I washed my face several times.  
  
Now I googled ""kids on fat bike amsterdam"" and this reddit post was the very first result.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Amsterdam/comments/1dmpm2n/spat\_on\_face\_by\_kid\_on\_fatbike/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amsterdam/comments/1dmpm2n/spat_on_face_by_kid_on_fatbike/)

Amsterdam,Amsterdam is two cities at once,"I recently moved to Amsterdam after spending a few years in Groningen, so I’m still settling in and getting a feel for the city. I've been settling in Oost, quiet streets, familiar faces at the cafés, and that relaxed local rhythm where people actually stop to chat with neighbors or sit outside when the sun finally shows up.

The moment I bike into the center it’s chaos, tourists, stag parties, the same pancake menus everywhere. Then ten minutes later, back in Oost, it feels like a completely different world again

Feels almost surreal that both realities live so close together.   
For those of you who’ve been here longer, how do you balance the two Amsterdams? Do you avoid the center completely, or do you still dip in sometimes for certain spots/events and then retreat back to your own neighborhood bubble?",238,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amsterdam/comments/1mvcolg/amsterdam_is_two_cities_at_once/,1755690909.0,125,Amsterdam bike,search,2025-08-20 11:55:09

Amsterdam,Got threatened by an aggressive taxi driver in Amsterdam today—what the hell is wrong with people?,"Today I had a terrifying experience while biking in the center of Amsterdam. A taxi driver tried to drop off passengers directly in the middle of the bike lane. I tried my best not to hit the people getting out, but the taxi was literally blocking the entire lane. In the chaos, I ended up hitting his mirror.

Instead of realizing he was the one causing a dangerous situation, the driver sped up, blocked my way, and started threatening me, demanding I pay him 50 euros. He was yelling and acting super aggressively—honestly, it felt like he was on something. It wasn’t just anger—it was unhinged.

Luckily, a few people nearby stepped in and protected me, which probably made him back off. He eventually drove away, still furious. But I was genuinely shaken. I’ve been biking here for a while and I know the city can be chaotic, but this felt next-level unsafe.

Amsterdam,"Maniac with a hammer chased me in Amsterdam, police refused to help","Yesterday I moved into a new apartment in Amsterdam (July 25th). Today, I was walking home from the supermarket, talking on the phone in English, carrying a bag of groceries.

Out of nowhere, a guy on a fatbike started yelling at me in Dutch. I ignored him. Then he circled back, rode towards me, and started screaming in Spanish and English: “Hijo de puta,” “homosexual,” “I’m going to kill you,” “Suriname,” “Dominican Republic,” “I’ll kill you, hijo de puta, call the police come on motherfucker”

I’m Argentine. I wasn’t doing anything, just walking home talking on the phone. Then I saw he had a hammer in his hand.

I asked a nearby man, “Hey, can you help me? This guy has a hammer.” The guy said, “No, fight him.” I replied, “I don’t want to fight, I’m tired.” He kept pushing me to fight. I said, “If he comes close, I’ll defend myself,” and he said, “Alright, I’ll help you.”

Luckily, nothing happened in the end. But it easily could have.

I went straight to the police station. And it was a disaster.

They kept giving me different excuses for not helping me:

•	⁠First, the policewoman said the attack happened in another district (Venserpolder), so I should go there.
•	⁠Then she said they couldn’t believe me because I had no “proof.”
•	⁠Then she said they were too busy to help right now. -Then she said they could file a report, but wouldn’t give me a copy or any proof of it.
•	⁠Finally, the officer, clearly annoyed, told me:

“We’re extremely busy, if you want to open a real investigation, I can give you an appointment in one week, it takes 1.5 hours.”

So that’s what I had to do. I scheduled it. But it’s completely useless for my current situation.

The thing is: I had just moved into a new apartment through HousingAnywhere. They give you 48 hours to cancel and request a refund if there’s a safety issue. But they require a police report as proof.

Now I can’t get one on time, not because the attack didn’t happen but because the police refused to help.

So I left the apartment. I’m staying in a hotel again.

And I’ll probably lose the first month’s rent because no one in authority wanted to take 10 minutes to write a report, even just a note , despite me being almost attacked with a hammer in broad daylight.

Amsterdam looks beautiful, but this experience has made me feel completely unsafe and abandoned.

This city needs to do better.

thenetherlands,A Love Letter to The Netherlands,"
Hi r/thenetherlands

I made a similar post to r/belgium because I lived there for some time and I felt compelled to do the same for you. I’m Canadian, born and raised in the beautiful city of Vancouver. I was a masters student at KU Leuven and I spent 6 months in Rotterdam as an intern as part of my degree, living on a farm in Krimpenerwaard. 

I just wanted to say that I miss you. I love the Netherlands. I’ve been to Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Delft, Scheidam, Utrecht, Maastricht, Leiden, Kinderdijk, Gouda, Dordrecht, and Haarlem. I loved it all. I loved all the cute canals, all the bike lanes, the gorgeous town halls. I loved the chaos of Amsterdam, the resilience and creativity of Rotterdam, the international feel of Den Haag, the coziness of Delft, Leiden, and Haarlem, the medieval vibe of Maastricht. I loved it all. 

The best word I can think of to describe the Netherlands is impressive. The Netherlands just impresses me, so much. It’s so pristine almost everywhere I’ve been. The Dutch are constantly innovating. Thinking about what’s next, how can we move forward. The Delta works are genuinely some of the most amazing and impressive works of engineering in the world. I love how you can be as far away from a city as possible and you’ll still have perfectly paved roads and bike lanes. I love how in a city like Rotterdam of like 600 thousand people you still had 4 subway lanes and countless trams. In a city of that size here in Canada you are waiting 30 minutes in the cold for your bus and take it like a bitch. 

I had such an amazing time in the Netherlands, met so many amazing people, and learned so much about myself and what i want in life when i was there. I miss the cheese. I miss the bitterballen. I miss the long bike rides home through Rotterdam after a date in Den Haag.

I really hope that i get to experience the Netherlands again. I’ll be applying for jobs there soon. I promise I’lll improve my shitty dutch. 

Also as a side note: Dutch women are so beautiful. 

Ik hou van jou, Nederland.

Amsterdam,Strange encounter on a Friday night,"Throwaway account. Last week, I was visiting my partner that is doing her Master’s in Amsterdam (we’re both females). We went to Albert Heijn (Jan de Jonghstraat) to get some groceries at around 9PM but got stopped by a group of seven young men on the way back. 

They asked us if we can call the police because there is a fight going on nearby. I saw some of them laughing and also holding smartphones in their hands so I said no, and told them to get the police themselves. They were quite adamant and did not want to let us go (held our bikes by force). 

We did not speak Dutch and they kept asking where we’re from — I was already feeling uncomfortable so I said I was not going to tell them. They surrounded us and wanted to see our groceries. I told them to let us go and they said they will, but still held our bikes. In the end, one of them said “yeah, just go. This is my neighbourhood, so just fucking go, otherwise I will fucking shoot you”. So we left while they all continued laughing. 

We did not call the police as realistically nothing really happened and we were also in a shock. The whole thing lasted probably only like three minutes but it just left a really bad feeling in me as this had never happened to me before. I know that we might just have been unlucky, but I do worry that this, or something worse might happen to my partner when she’ll be alone in that area. I guess I just wanted to vent here, but if anyone has any advice as to what do to in such a situation, please let us know too.

Amsterdam,tips for people visiting Amsterdam for the first time,"from my wonderful 17 days I just returned from. Locals and others please add and correct. Maybe this stuff seems obvious but it wasn't to me until I got there.

* Arriving
   * There's a train station in the airport. How great is that? Easily train to the Central Station.
   * You get off the train and walk south, toward the city, away from the harbor.\* It's overwhelming, maybe a bit scary. Take a breath. This is the hardest transportation challenge you will face; it gets easier after this.
   * The trams are directly in front of you, between you and the city.
   * How do you know which tram to take? Use google maps, enter your hotel/hostel destination, choose public transportation. Easy.
   * There are a lot of tram stops here, so you need to look around and find yours. Each stop has a nice electronic board that tells you which trams are coming in how many minutes.
   * How will you pay for it/buy a ticket? So simple. For now, just use your bank card. Hold it up to the card reader by the door. Important, as the nice lady tells you every trip, ""Don't forget to check out with your bankcard."" This is for your sake, otherwise you get charged additional.

\*unless you are staying in Amsterdam Noord, in which case go the opposite way and take a free ferry across the harbor.

* Getting around
   * To me, as an American, the trams were amazing. They go everywhere you need to go in town and you don't have to deal with a station or anything, they go down the middle of the street.
   * I bought a 7 day pass so I wouldn't have to think about cost and could go where I liked. There are other options through the GVB app. If you prefer to deal with a person, there is a GVB office, white building past the trams in front of the station. If you don't want to deal with any of it, use your bankcard. I assume this costs more? IDK
   * Enter the ""welcome"" door, not an exit door, put your card or phone up to the reader. Exit through an exit door and ""Don't forget to check out with your bankcard."" There is an electronic board that tells you the next few stops and when you are at a stop, connecting lines from there. By your second ride you'll be a pro.
   * There is also a metro system, entrances underground. Day passes include trams, busses, metro and ferries. The metro is also super easy to use and is faster for long distances. Everything is clear from the abundant signage in English. Use your card or phone to go through the entrance stiles and go.
   * I found uber to be a pain in the ass as the city was built long before cars. Especially true during busy times.
   * Many people rent a bike. I didn't because it just looked overwhelming to me.
   * Walking is the best way to get to know the city. IMPORTANT: The bikes have right of way. This is no joke. There are many people whipping around on bikes literally everywhere. A big boulevard will have: sidewalk, bike lane, car lane, tram track, tram track, car lane, bike lane, sidewalk. That's a lot. Sometimes the bike path might look like a pedestrian path. So just, any time you cross anything, look for the bikes. They may warn you with a bell, but they will not stop for you. Cars stop for you in zebra crossings; bikes not so much.
   * For me, the central are near Dam square is awful. It's interesting and historic, but crammed with people like god damn Disneyland and tons of tourist oriented shops. I recommend staying even a little way out, in the Jordaan, De Pijp, toward OosterPark, Noord, or anywhere else. Don't worry about getting to stuff you want to see in this area, because again, the trams. You could even stay in Haarlem or a small town outside of Amsterdam and take the train in in literally minutes.
* Saving money. It's an expensive city. I'm cheap/frugal so found some ways to save money.
   * Buy some groceries at Albert Heijn or other supermarkets, at a street market, etc. Saves big.
   * I stayed at a hostel. IDK if there are cheaper alternatives.
   * The museums are expensive but excellent. Choose wisely.
   * There is a CityPass but I didn't get one so IDK if it saves you or not.
   * I like the free ferry across the harbor.
   * There is an amazing view of the city from the top floor of the main branch of the city library, between the Central Station and the science museum.
   * Hang out in a park. Sometimes on Sunday you may find a free concert or something; I did.

YMMV on any of this. I hope this helps someone and that it is permissible in this sub.",113,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amsterdam/comments/1ndm4c4/tips_for_people_visiting_amsterdam_for_the_first/,1757528552.0,84,Amsterdam bike,search,2025-09-10 18:22:32
urbanplanning,Why do modern cities still lack multi-zoning?,"Hi,

In old cities, we always have the historic part full of life, because it mixes habitations and commerces in a beautiful way. However, in North America and even in some parts of Europe, every new neighborhood getting build are lacking what make a living city.

I understand it's the car-centric culture that created this problem, but why is it so hard to pivot?

For example, in my city we have a dead city center, because nobody lives there. It only has some stores, restaurants and some offices. So, during the weekday, it's alive, because of the office workers, but other than that, it's completely dead. Mayor is complaining about this place so much and trying to get back some life, but they don't understand that building expensive condos in the area will not work. We need to bring back middle-class in the center, but nobody seems to understand.

Other than that, the fact that all stores are always in the same spot, everyone need to take the car to do something.

I just wish walkable city would be a thing here in North America or in new neighborhood in the world. It's not by putting one cafe for 200 hours that you can call it ""mixed"". It needs office, general store, etc. All parts of the city should a little town by itself. Or right now, everyone is focusing on cycling to be like Amsterdam, but they don't realize that in Amsterdam, you can do everything you want under 10 minutes bike ride. Here it would take 45 minutes to 1h just to get somewhere by bike.

We talk a lot about the new 15-minutes cities or whatever they are working on, but I still don't see it being worked on.

Why is it so difficult these days to change the zoning or develop new part of cities in a better way?

Thank you",105,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/1l9towd/why_do_modern_cities_still_lack_multizoning/,1749752273.0,27,Amsterdam cycling,search,2025-06-12 18:17:53

Amsterdam,Help. Am I being tracked against my will?,"Please help me understand whether I’m actually being tracked, or if it’s just a bug. 

Today as I came back home from an exercise class I got 7 notifications that unknown trackers were seen moving with me. Multiple AirTags, but also other trackers: a 6ATAG3 and a AIYATO-L1 (see picture). I am extremely creeped out and don’t know if it’s more likely a bug or I should be worried. Please help me. 

Details:
- even though, in the picture, the notifications seem to have come throughout the day, this is not correct. The notifications all arrived more or less together, when I made it home after an exercise class. All notifications took place within one hour.
- of course, the moment I saw the notifications I tried to play the sound. The chance of the trackers being inside the home is extremely unlikely, I only took a water bottle and my phone to the class. But I went by bike, so this i assume is where the trackers, if any, might be. It was and still is pouring rain. When I open my window, I can see my bike and try to listen. I think I heard one of the AirTags, but I can’t be 100% sure. Then when I went down to the bike, it was pouring, and I couldn’t hear any of the trackers.

Context:
- I biked from home to the exercise class and back, alone. No friends, no colleagues, no classmates. By myself. It’s been raining a lot, so there weren’t many bikers. It’s extremely unlikely someone that I didn’t notice happened to bike right behind me all the way to the exercise class, and back.
- It’s a “good”, bougie neighborhood. 
- Not that it matters, but I’m 30AFAB
-Having grown up in LATAM, I take things like this seriously 

Has anyone else experienced this? Is this something you have heard of happening in Amsterdam?

Amsterdam,Copenhagen is basically an upgraded version of Amsterdam,"I have been living for some time in Copenhagen before coming to live here, and I noticed a lot of similarities. But as time goes by, I am noticing that many things make Copenhagen a better city overall.

First, the housing situation has some similarities, but Copenhagen is still way easier to figure out—and cheaper. Also, the transportation is way more efficient and cheaper as well. In Amsterdam, you pay a shitload of money and after 00:30 there is no more metro, even during the weekend? For a city that is avoiding cars that much, it is crazy to me.

The bike culture is another similarity, but once again, in Copenhagen it is way better organized. As a pedestrian, you don’t fear getting bumped by a bike at every corner.

Copenhagen also doesn’t have that not-so-nice type of tourism coming mainly to get stoned.

On the positive side, grocery shopping is way better and cheaper here in the Netherlands.

But in the end, salaries are higher in Copenhagen than in Amsterdam, with cheaper housing, so I think it balances out.

Sorry for the rant guys, but I wanted to know if people had experienced the two cities as well and have the same impression—or maybe a totally different one?",94,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amsterdam/comments/1jssue0/copenhagen_is_basically_an_upgraded_version_of/,1743941992.0,129,Amsterdam bike,search,2025-04-06 12:19:52
bikecommuting,Broke my arm on my commuter…..,"And aside from the obvious frustrations relating to work and household tasks that are way more difficult now, my biggest peeve about the situation is not being able to bike until the cast comes off. 

I’ll be honest, I was riding irresponsibly fast. I was going downhill on my commuter bike (7-speed ebike) on a leisure ride in a park’s bike trail near me. Despite the posted warnings about steep drop offs, I was continuing to peddle while going downhill and gaining speed beyond the posted recommendation. The trail started to curve, and I was too preoccupied with my map to notice a pothole. I tried to brake but I still went flying downhill off the paved track and landed on my elbow. Complex dislocation of the humerus and broken elbow… on my dominant arm to boot… But I remain grateful that I got off so easily for that and that I was wearing my helmet. And thank god there was a passerby near enough to witness this and help me pull the bike off from on top of me while I waited for a ride to the ER!

So yeah, totally my fault. And I can’t wait to get a chance to get back out there and ride my bike again (it looks mostly undamaged as well). ",83,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o04bdo,1759808583.0,14,fallback_new,fallback,2025-10-07 03:43:03

Netherlands,"Being Threatened by a Homeless Man Staying Illegally in My Neighbor’s Apartment – What Can I Do? (Netherlands, Social Housing)","
Hello everyone,
I’m currently living in a social housing apartment in Amsterdam and would like to share a serious situation I’m dealing with. I’d appreciate any legal advice or suggestions.

There is a tenant living (70years old) upstairs who constantly invites homeless people into his apartment. They often stay for long terms. These individuals use drugs and, disturbingly, the tenant provides his apartment for prostitution. On several occasions, he has brought homeless women from the streets and offered to others in exchange for money. Their conversations echo through the building, and the situation has become very disturbing and unsafe.

Due to my physical disability, I already feel vulnerable. Today, one of the homeless men staying (illegally) in that apartment for 5 years (a Polish man, approximately 35 years old) hit my arm while I was closing the front door and demanded I open it for him. I refused, telling him I didn’t have key. He pushed my arm again, saying, “I told you to open the door.”

This same individual is banned from entering the building because last year, he stole the keys and illegally entered the apartment of our 84-year-old neighbor on the third floor. That neighbor filed a complaint with both the police and the housing company. A nearby neighbor also told me that whenever this man is seen in the building, the police should be called immediately. Despite this, he continues to stay here regularly with the upstairs tenant. Neighbors in building have also reported him to both the police and the housing company, but nothing seems to happen.

Today, while I was closing the building’s front door, he suddenly appeared again. I repeated that I didn’t have my key. He responded aggressively, pushed my arm, and demanded again that I open the door. A moment later, the upstairs tenant (the one who houses him) came down and opened the door. The homeless man then threatened me, saying, “I’ll kill you! I know where you live!” He hit me on the shoulder and spat at me.

I immediately went downstairs and called the police. While I was on the phone with them, he came at me and my spouse with a pair of scissors in his hand and tried to attack us. Had we not defended ourselves, we could have been seriously harmed.

Afterward, he pointed at our apartment and repeated his threat: “I know where you live. I’ll kill you.” He then got on his bike and left. The police arrived just 2 minutes later. They knocked on the door of the apartment where the man had been staying, but another homeless man answered the door instead of the tenant. When the officers asked who the attacker was, he simply replied “Polish,” said he didn’t know him, and added, “I’m not the tenant.”

The police then told me they would inform the neighborhood officer. I expressed concern that the man might come back and harm us. Unfortunately, the police said that although his behavior is criminal, it’s considered a “low-level offense” and there’s not much they can do unless something more serious happens.

I asked them: “So if I get seriously hurt or have to defend myself and hurt him, will that finally be a high-level crime?” They responded that unfortunately, a more serious incident is required before they can take action. They said the neighborhood officer will contact me for follow-up.

When I asked what would happen if he came back in an hour and attacked me again, they told me to call the police again. I asked, “But if you don’t take action, what good will it do to call again?” They said: “Unless there’s something serious, we cannot do anything. The tenant is allowed to invite guests into his home.”

I responded, “Of course he can invite guests, but not to commit criminal acts. And in social housing, only the registered tenant is allowed to live there. Long-term stays, cohabitation, subletting, and regularly hosting homeless people are prohibited unless authorized. Social housing is for personal use only.”

They advised me to contact the housing corporation, they also said they couldn’t control him and he is allowed to invite people in his house and they don’t want to understand.

So my questions are:
	1- What can be done to protect ourselves before something worse happens?

      2- Are there any legal steps we can take against the tenant or the attacker?

      3- Can we push the housing corporation to take action based on the misuse of the apartment?

	4- What kind of self-defense item is legal to carry in the Netherlands for protection purposes?

       5- Is there any way to forcefully remove the homeless man from the building since he is banned and has a history of illegal activity?

We are genuinely scared for our safety and being regularly threatened.

Thank you in advance for any help or advice.

Edit: I found out that “TIW Defence Spray” is not illegal, so I bought it.

Edit 2: Thanks for all the comments. I couldn’t respond to everyone, but I really appreciate your input.

All of the neighbors in the building are over 70 years old, while my wife and I are in our early 30s. And all of them are complaining about him. Our next-door neighbor has known this tenant for 25 years. She told me that during those years, the tenant (who lives above us) used his wife for illegal prostitution, sold drugs, and always found ways to earn money from others without working. Both he and his wife were addicted to substances. His wife passed away last year.

For many years, the situation wasn’t this serious, but now it has escalated. Many people come to his social apartment and stay for long periods, one of them has been living there for 4–5 years.

My next door neighbor also told me that the housing company is planning to install cameras in the building to monitor the situation. However, she said that wouldn’t really prove anything, since it wouldn’t show what’s happening inside the apartment. She said she would contact the manager of the housing company to ask what exactly needs to happen before they take serious action.

Yesterday, the police didn’t file any report, but today I will file a complaint online with both the police and the housing company. The wijkagent still hasn’t called me.

Edit 3:
Today, we went to the police station to request a copy of the crime report that wasn’t given to us yesterday. However, they told us that no official crime report was filed. There is only a kind of complaint recorded in their system, but they couldn’t print it out or proceed with filing it because they consider the incident too minor to take further action.

Our wijkagent (neighborhood officer) was also present, and we met her for the first time. She told us that she is aware of the situation and promised to speak with the tenant who has been inviting homeless people into the building. She said she would inform the housing company and the gemeente (municipality), as this behavior is not normal and action should be taken before things escalate further. She also recommended calling the police immediately if anything happens again, so they can witness the situation directly. She explained that there has been a note on the address in their system for years, and when we call, they will be able to see the ongoing issues associated with it. That’s all for now.",82,https://www.reddit.com/r/Netherlands/comments/1m85mji/being_threatened_by_a_homeless_man_staying/,1753366645.0,42,Amsterdam bike,search,2025-07-24 14:17:25

Amsterdam,Short day trips from Amsterdam by bike - Muiden Castle/Muiderslot,"**Introduction**

Lying around 16km from centraal station Muiden castle (sometimes called Amsterdam castle, though it’s in no way in Amsterdam, only part of its defenses) is an easy day out by bicycle.

The castle has a really interesting history which starts in the 13th century and you can read about here [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muiden\_Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muiden_Castle)

There is also a small garden with herbs and flowers and a cafe that does, among other things, Holtkamp cakes - which is a very fine thing.

  
**Other things to do** 

Once you are done with the castle there are a few other options for walks - along the old fort walls there is a marked route running around the old town from the Parkeerplaats Ravelijnsplein (P2) or you can also walk from there along the lake towards Muidenberg (turn left from Noordpolderweg by the picnic bench and follow the path along the water as far as you like, or turn back onto the Noordpolderweg where it meets Dijkweg). There is a cute little farm shop called De Koeienkade on this route.

The town itself is pretty small, but the walls are interesting and there are two nice churches and some nice views of the water and boats pottering about.

It’s also possible to take the boat to the Pampuseiland in season, which is very nice in good weather.

**Practical information**

**Website -**

[https://muiderslot.nl/](https://muiderslot.nl/)

**Route -**

Probably the nicest route to take from the center is out over the Waterkeringpad, over the Nesciobrug, down the Diemerzeedijk and follow that along the (seasonally open) part to Muiden. This also takes you past the small fort Westbatterij and gives some views towards the Pampus island fortress on the lake.

If you know how the Dutch bicycle route numbers work its (from CS)

05-52-54-55-25-27 then straight on along the Diemerzeedijk.

[https://www.anwb.nl/fietsroutes/fietsknooppuntenplanner](https://www.anwb.nl/fietsroutes/fietsknooppuntenplanner) is the site for this.

A good route back is over the Kanaaldijk (16-15-59-55 by the route numbers).

If going by car you can park for free at P1 Weesperweg and walk over. P2 in the town is paid parking.

**Times -** 

10am - 5pm daily

**Price -** 

19.50 euro (my god!) or free with various cards (fortunately I have one!)

**Eating -**

There are a few nice places in Muiden and a bakery by the bridge.

Café Ome Ko for example or Floris Muiden (some people dont like that place but for me it’s OK). I’ve not had a chance to try Ruis Aan De Sluis yet but it looks good.

If you dont want a full sit down cafe there is a small snack bar on the P2 parking place.

There is also a (newish) nice ice cream place on Kazernstraat.",54,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mpu8fb,1755158054.0,12,Amsterdam bike,search,2025-08-14 07:54:14
Amsterdam,2 explosions in 2 weeks on my street,"So, last week there was an explosion just two houses down from us. We heard a loud bang at around 1 in the morning accompanied by considerable amount of flames. At first, I thought it might have been a malfunctioning e-bike battery type of explosion or some sort, but soon I learned it was a deliberate act.

Then just last night, barely a week later, around the same time, we were awoken again by another loud bang. This time it was about five houses away, but still on the same street. Yet another explosion. The damage seemed less severe, but it was still unsettling.

I’m relatively new to Amsterdam (moved here about 3 years ago), and I honestly never expected to experience something like this in the Netherlands. I was warned about the weather and the food, but never about explosions! What's concerning is that after doing a bit of digging online, I found that explosions like these aren't rare here. And honestly, that’s terrifying.

What also surprised me, aside from the explosions themselves, was the way the authorities handled the situation. From what I saw, the police showed up mainly to escort the firefighters, and once the fire was out, they left the scene. No visible follow-up, no police presence, no taped-off area.

Just wanted to be clear - I’m not saying the police aren’t doing their job or that they should do what I’m used to. It's just an observation. I don’t claim to know how these situations are normally or should be  handled here. But where I’m from (where explosions have also happened), the area would typically be cordoned off, guarded overnight, and thoroughly investigated before being cleared. At the very least, they’d make it clear, both to the public and to whoever might be behind it that they’re taking it seriously.

Anyway, I really hope something can and will be done to prevent this from happening again and again. Apologies if this post comes off as too negative - I just wanted to share my experience and thoughts.

bikecommuting,"Tired of the misinformation out there - If your lock is long enough, secure the rear wheel AND the frame.","[Picture from Kryptonite's website. See how the wheel and frame is secured within the U-lock. https:\/\/www.kryptonitelock.fr\/en\/proper-lockup-landing\/bicycle-lock-up-bike.html](https://preview.redd.it/58zv0fy87cuf1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f636ba1fe29da3c82a2713c110910eff057e88ae)

I keep seeing people repeat the “Sheldon Brown method” like it’s the gold standard of bike security but there’s an important flaw that often gets overlooked.

Sheldon’s original idea was to use a small U-lock to go through just the rear wheel and the rack. The logic was that because the frame can’t come off without cutting the wheel, it would deter thieves.

But the problem is that the wheel can be cut, and quite easily. It’s not common, but it’s absolutely possible and with the price of bike frames and e-bikes these days, cutting a wheel rim to steal a 2k frame and groupset is worth it for a thief. Here's a video demonstrating this. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9fLtdZyX-A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9fLtdZyX-A)

If your lock is big enough, it’s *always* better to go through both the rear wheel and the frame. That way:

* The lock secures the *most valuable part* (the frame).
* The wheel is still protected.
* A thief can’t just cut the wheel or pop it off to get the frame.

For those concerned about the would-be thief using leverage to break the lock, the thing is, there is little leverage to be gained when the lock is between the rear spokes and seatstay or chainstay.

Amsterdam,Be careful where you park your car,"So, I’m back from a 3-day trip to Amsterdam, which actually lasted 5 days. We left our car with electric bikes at the Interparking IJ-oever Centrum parking lot. On the second day, we took the bikes out of the trunk, rode briefly due to bad weather, and then put them back. The next day, when the weather improved, we went to the parking lot (which is gated and seems secure, with access only via a card after prior reservation) to take out the bikes for a trip. To our shock, we found the car with a broken window and one bike stolen.

The parking lot has cameras, gates, and barriers, but the parking lot owner only advised us to report the theft to the police and offered no further assistance. To make matters worse, when leaving the parking lot, the system wouldn’t read our ticket, forcing us to pay an additional €120 at the on-site payment machine. The machine menu wasn’t in English, so it wasn’t clear how the “additional payment” process worked. We finally managed to leave after contacting the parking support team and providing our reservation number.

How did the thief get in and out with the bike? Could the parking camera operators be facilitating the thefts? I can't think of another explanation. We only learned from the hotel staff afterward that thefts at this parking lot are quite common. I strongly advise against using this parking lot.

Is there any way to recover the bike? Or at least make it harder for the thief to sell it by sharing the frame number?",45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amsterdam/comments/1h397wr/be_careful_where_you_park_your_car/,1732959723.0,40,Amsterdam bike,search,2024-11-30 09:42:03

How big of a nuisance is rush hour?

Does it slow you down?

What speed does bike traffic generally move at during rush hour?

Amsterdam,Is it safe and reasonable to bike from Bullewijk (Zuidoost) to Zuid/RAI?,"https://preview.redd.it/2hzd93ev8buf1.png?width=1161&format=png&auto=webp&s=be964df1366f0af986079018a8a54ba58377ca2b

Hi all,

I’m considering biking from Bullewijk station (Amsterdam Zuidoost) to Amsterdam Zuid or RAI for my commute, and I’m wondering how realistic this is. Google Maps shows it’s around 8–10 km, which doesn’t sound too bad, but I have a few concerns:

* Some stretches look quite remote, with little lighting or housing nearby — is it safe to bike there, especially in the evenings?
* How much does wind affect the ride, especially along the Amstel or more open areas?
* Do people regularly make this commute by bike, or is it more common to just take the train/metro instead?

Would love to hear from anyone with experience on this route — whether it’s worth it, or if public transport is the smarter choice.

Thanks!

EDIT: Thanks for the insights so far! Just to add context, I’m a 28-year-old female. I wonder if that might change the experience, especially biking alone in the evenings.",36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amsterdam/comments/1o35ns6/is_it_safe_and_reasonable_to_bike_from_bullewijk/,1760113643.0,38,Amsterdam bike,search,2025-10-10 16:27:23

cycling,Biking in America vs Italy/France/Nederlands,"
This year has been a really big bike year for me. I learned a lot about a sport I love to watch from just riding the same roads as the pros, racing some crits, and riding in a group ride that is filled with Cat 2 and 3 racers where we have 5 designated race sections. 

But riding in Europe is just completely different. And somehow, Colorado is worse than Tennessee. 

Story time: I'm stoned and I need to rant, with some background. 

I got to ride 400km of unique road around Leiden, Amsterdam. Not fucking once did the concern of getting hit by a car cross my mind. I put some fucking miles down and I've never felt more free in my life. I could bike far, see cool shit, and not worry about a car killing me.

I got to see the climb up Col du Galibier in person this year. I rode up there from the village below the climb. I can't tell you how at home I felt to be with that many cyclists. Once the tour came through, we fucking mobbed down the Col du Lauteret. Hundreds of people, of various skill levels, biking down a mountain pass is a beautiful thing. Especially when you're putting the watts down and you get on to a train and start trading pulls with strangers that you trust because you can see their line choices. 

Then the next day I climbed Col du Granon and Col du Galbier. Holy shit the pro riders are strong. That broke me. It's been years since I've hurt that bad. And for those men, it's just day 16 of 21. But also, there were so many cyclists out riding their bikes that there are photographers who take candid photos to sell to you. 

Then I move to Colorado for the winter. I got yelled at today to ride on the sidewalk by several cars when I was doing 18 in a 25. Then on the way down from the climb, there were other cyclists going up. Which was really cool to see. I was hella stoked and trying to cheer them on when I saw them. 

And then this fucking car driving too fast goes to pass a cyclist climbing uphill swings out in my lane while I'm doing 50kmh downhill at it. Like, what the fuck?!?! I never even had this shit happen to me in Tennessee, and definitely not in Europe. I got harassed in Tennessee, but not like this. It's like every damn time I go out on my bike here in Colorado someone almost hits me. I don't freaking get it. And after knowing what it can be like from famous biking areas in France to just the general freedom and safety in the Nederlands...

I fucking hate car first infrastructure. ",33,https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/1gsjc7v/biking_in_america_vs_italyfrancenederlands/,1731747303.0,19,Amsterdam bike,search,2024-11-16 08:55:03
Amsterdam,Scooter parking that blocks bike racks? (What to do…),"I live pretty central in Amsterdam. Every weekend a scooter appears and parks inbetween two bike racks, blocking everyone in (imagine two opposite racks with the back bike wheels facing each other). 

It’s hard for the local ‘bewoners’ who park there each day to get out. Sometimes impossible without touching the scooter. Nevermind trying to park your bike into these racks. 

It blows my mind there are people out there that would park a scooter like this and feel okay about it. So obviously blocking >10 bikes from moving. It seems so selfish!

We have left notes. Last weekend somebody tagged on it. Nothing seems to make them consider parking elsewhere. Is this a case for photo/send to the Gementee, or are they technically breaking no rules? 

Edit: pictures for context. Today we wrote a note from all the neighbours asking them to not park here anymore blocking in all our bikes. Included the “threat” that next time it happens they will be reported to Gementee. 

Thank you all for providing great tips on where to report that might result in some support/action!

Amsterdam,Why is south part of Van Woustraat neglected?,"I live close to Van Woustraat, and I’ve been noticing something odd. The northern part of the street has been fully renovated with proper bike lanes, wide sidewalks, and generally a much nicer layout. It really feels like the municipality invested there to improve both traffic flow and the overall quality of life.

But once you head further south, it’s a completely different story. The municipality once had plans to renovate that part too, but they were cancelled. The contrast is striking. Where the “cute” Amsterdam houses are, everything feels well taken care of. But as soon as those houses end, the street changes drastically, it’s like night and day. Biking there is a nightmare.

Honestly, it feels like the city is prioritizing infrastructure that benefits tourists (nicer spots, picture-perfect houses). The newer part of De Pijp seems neglected in general, and it makes me wonder if this is an intentional choice or just something that fell off the agenda.

I was in 4 cities these being amsterdam, utrecht, rotterdam and The Hague (Den Haag). I was surprised by a number of things coming from Canada like the air quality.

(also the only things I know are that the trains are expensive, the air is amazing compared to a canadian suburb and yes I know everything is expensive in the netherlands. I also know its nice riding a bike but I noticed more near the center of town there are less protected bike lanes and you are in the same lane as the car but at least its low speed limit for cars but as you get further from the city it gets better.

  
TL:DR what's it like being a local compared to being a tourist (I'm aware everything is more expensive and especially the NS train. also NGL I don't mind paying more if the service is great as in canada transit is basically made for the poor so I completely don't mind paying extra)",20,https://www.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/1ndrsra/whats_the_difference_of_being_in_the_netherlands/,1757542147.0,125,Amsterdam bike,search,2025-09-10 22:09:07
Amsterdam,"Stolen in Vondelpark: phone and wallet thrown in separate bins, still confused.","I went to Vondelpark yesterday by car with my toddler and newborn to meet a friend for a play date. I had parked on Koninginneweg, did the usual stroller dance, and headed into the park to one of the playgrounds. About an hour in, I realized my phone was missing.

I borrowed my friend’s phone and called my partner (we share location). At first, he told me that my phone was showing up near where I had parked the car, then moving deeper inside the park. So I started walking towards my car.

When I got to the car, I noticed it was not locked — which was weird but maybe postpartum brain didn’t lock it— but nothing seemed missing at first glance. My power bank was still on the seat, some coins were in the center console, and even the shopping bags with clothes I had just bought were still in the trunk. Everything looked… oddly in order.

I started calling my number repeatedly.

After ringing twice, a woman answers and says that a man has found my phone in a trash can, and that they were near the Picasso sculpture. When I got there, I saw a man with a Donkey Republic bike and grocery bags full of bottles, and the woman (with a baby in a carrier) nearby. I came over saying “thank you, thank you,” relieved that my phone wasn’t gone.

They weren’t together — she just said, “Here’s the man who found your phone,” and the guy said:

“I was looking through the trash can at one of the entrances of the park and I saw a phone case and thought it was weird, so I took it and realized it was an actual phone. Then some Moroccan kids offered me €50, but when I saw your baby on the lockscreen, I couldn’t do that to a mom.”

I was so confused, and then the woman added, “You can help him with something,” winked at me, and walked off.

He didn’t directly ask for money, but the implication was clear. I felt pressured and said, “Let me check what I have in my wallet,” and walked with him back to my bag which was with my friend. That’s when I realized my wallet was also missing.

My friend only had €4 in coins, which I offered him. He actually looked offended and didn’t take them at first — but when he saw how worked up I was getting, he finally said, “Okay, give them to me,” and left.

Thankfully, I had a tracker in the wallet. It was showing at Emmaplein, outside the park, and by this time my partner had already left the office and biked toward the location and realized it was in the restafval container. I went there to meet him and happened to see a police officer. I explained the whole situation, and he really pushed it for me — calling the gemeente, Handhaving, and following up until, after a few minutes, they arrived and opened the sides of the trash can.

When they opened it, I could see my wallet at the bottom, along with most of my cards, my two Bijenkorf gift cards (unused), and the tracker, just scattered. The container wasn’t even full, but there was no way I could’ve reached it myself. And of course, they’re not going to empty the trash can for me. So… that was it.
So weird — why not take the gift cards? (Thank God I had the code for one of them written down on a piece of paper at home, so I checked it and the saldo was intact. I bought something immediately just to secure the credit.)

Now I’m left trying to piece this together:
- Did I drop the phone and wallet on the way into the park?
- Did I leave them in the car and someone opened it? (Though nothing else was touched.)
- Why were the phone and wallet dumped in two separate bins?
- Why toss a phone that could be sold?

Was this just a theft followed by an opportunist trying to get a reward, or something more coordinated?

Amsterdam,Advice on theft,"Hello people. I am a Greek guy living in Amsterdam the last 4 years so I don't speak dutch yet. 
At 27 of December as I left a friend's house at massluistraat in nieuw west I found out that somebody tried to steal my vanmoof bike but only succeed to damage it and steal my powerbank after breaking the lock.
 At 2 of January I saw my powerbank on markplaats for sale(I personally modified the cable with a different than the original so it is unique).I texted him that I am interested to buy it and I met him at sierplein and confronted him.The powerbank was damaged and he immediately called six more people that came running and screaming at me, threatening to kill me,insulting me and accusing me that I try to steal it. I called the cops immediately but of course they left with my powerbank before any police arrives. 
I made after that a police report describing everything and I mentioned that half of them had uncovered faces and I was standing in front of an Albert heijn camera.
The moment they left they were in contact throug markplaats with my partner trying to sell it to her so I can make the meeting again. Two days now I am calling the police and asking for back up so they can arrest and me retrieve my property but the police I feel like they dodging me. It is a time sensitive matter as they will disappear if they sell it.

Any advice?

bikecommuting,Do you think Euro-style bike leasing is possible in the US?,"Germany, especially, is a leader in companies offering bike leasing for employees. Data comes from the German [Zukunft Fahrrad](https://zukunft-fahrrad.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-market-study-cycling-industry.pdf). and the [German Federal Ministry of Digital Affairs and Transport](https://www.bmv.de/SharedDocs/DE/Anlage/StV/fahrradmonitor-kurzfassung-englisch.pdf?__blob=publicationFile).

As of 2025, over 269,000 German employers offer bike leasing programs, covering about 41% of the employed population. Employees can lease bikes through their employer, with payments deducted from their gross salary— generous tax codes make renting a bike much less expensive, even over the long run.

In the end, employees can save up to 30-40% on the cost of a bike compared to purchasing it outright. After a typical 36-month lease, they have the option to buy the bike for a fraction of its original price. At the moment, leasing schemes are particularly appealing to younger employees, with 76% of workers aged 18-29 expressing interest in company bike programs.

The government is essentially giving a tax break, so employers and employees are drawn to purchase and ride bikes. Bike leasing is picking up across Europe (you may be familiar with Lease-A-Bike from the pro peloton). It's more complex and not as direct as e-bike vouchers, which many US states and cities are adopting, but perhaps more effective and structured. Do you think it's something the US could adopt to encourage bike commuting?",13,https://www.reddit.com/r/bikecommuting/comments/1odb8tk/do_you_think_eurostyle_bike_leasing_is_possible/,1761146529.0,29,fallback_new,fallback,2025-10-22 15:22:09

Amsterdam,Help (Re)-Learning How to Cycle,"Hello!

I arrived in Amsterdam earlier this week and turns out the saying “just like riding a bike” doesn’t apply to me. Perhaps I didn’t learn all the fundamentals when I was young but it felt like I’d never been on a bike before and cycling back home on the Swapfiets I overconfidently rented was harrowing to say the least.

I’ve gone through old posts here where people have asked the same question and I’ve gotten some great tips I’ll be implementing - working on balance, practicing in a park etc. 

What I’m really after though is a teacher. I know myself and I learn far better if I can ask questions and there’s someone I can talk to. I’ve contacted Jimmy from Koala Bike Lessons and he only has availability in June and so far, community centers have lessons at times that don’t work for someone with a job. Does anyone know another private teacher or would be willing to give me some lessons that could start asap? I really feel I’d be missing out lots if I don’t learn to cycle. 

I’m based in Westerpark, super close to the park.

urbanplanning,A city without private transport (cars).,"If we imagine a very big city that has a population of 10 million people. Can it sustain itself completely without any kind of private vehicles? Most US cities have high usage of cars, and they are car-centric. If we make a car-banned city, create public transportation infrastructure, trams on every street in the city, and we can create a large system of buses, we can make a beautiful city that doesn't suck. There would be trees encompassing the sidewalks, so that people who are walking can have shade. We might not have the budget to get a tram in the suburbs. So, we can use small [shuttle buses](https://www.alibaba.com/showroom/shuttle-bus.html) to transport people from one place to another. 

Plus, massively expanding the existing metro systems. The metro seats should be sorted like the buses, so that everyone can sit in the metro. There would be high-speed rail encompassing the entire country so that people can travel from one big city to another in a short time. Banning cars might also prevent accidents. 

There would be no need for private transport at all (except bikes). We will transform all the big roads into public city centers. Instead of having big 6-lane roads out of nowhere in the city and a BIG parking lot, we can turn all those roads into beautiful public recreational areas. If you want to drive a car, like if you want to ride a horse, you can go to some tracks, where you can drive your favorite car. 

I don't know if it would be sustainable for small cities to make such a thing, but I think it might be feasible for big cities.

thenetherlands,Travelling to Utrecht and Volendam - Renting through Ov-fiets,"Hi everybody,

I'm a tourist from France who's coming to visit Utrecht and Volendam in early august.   
I'll be visiting with my partner and some family and we'd like to experience the dutch way of travelling, i.e with a bike. 

I did some research and found out that you need an ov-chipkaard to rent bike through Ov-fiets, a card that you can only get with a Dutch bank account (which I obviously dont have). If you dont have one, there seems to be an alternative which is called a Region Pass that you can order a few weeks before your trip and that allows you to rent bikes through Ov-fiets, you just have to pick up the card at a station in Utrecht or Amsterdam. 

Therefore, I have questions about this : 

\- Does the region pass still exists ? If so, how can I manage to get one ? All the links I've seen that should have redirected me to the actual procedure are inactive. 

\- I had hip surgery earlier this month and even If I'll be able to bike, I'd rather rent an e-bike to unload some stress out of my hip. Is it possible to rent an e-bike with this pass ? Is it easy to find e-bikes to rent ? 

\- And last question, I'll be travelling through Utrecht and Volendam, If I get this pass in Utrecht, will it also be usable in Volendam (Or the nearest station) ?

Thanks to those who'll take time to read me and answer those questions,

So, I’m kinda new with this whole city biking thing. Just got myself a second-hand e-bike here in Zürich, and already realised rain is basically every second day, ja. Commute to work every morning and my old jacket plus umbrella combo is useless. I actually thought there was nothing I could do to stop the experience for now, but while I was scrolling online, I found these “bike umbrella” things on Alibaba. Basically a canopy you clamp to the handlebars, keeps you dry when it pours. Looks clever in the picture, but honestly I don’t trust it, ja.

My buddy already laughed said I’ll fly away like Mary Poppins the first windy day on the lake. And the Föhn can get crazy, eh. But still, commuting every morning to work in the Regen is not so sexy. Poncho makes me schwitzen like crazy, normal umbrella in hand is just gopferdammi impossible while riding.

So my questions, anyone in CH actually tried one of these umbrellas?  How safe is it when the Föhn wind kicks in?  Is it better to just pay for proper rain gear from a local shop instead of cheap online gadget?

I don’t need to look cool, eh, just want to get to work without being soaked like a dumpling. If anyone has experience with these bike umbrellas, please tell me.

Amsterdam,Zebra crossings on cycling paths next to intersections with traffic lights: why?,"When I'm cycling, I usually yield to pedetrians (or try to, at least; they often don't go). The one situation in which I usually don't is if I'm on an intersection where the bike and car traffic is regulated with traffic lights, but then the cycling path has a zebra crossing, like on the intersection of De Clercqstraat and Bilderijkstraat, or Overtoom and Eerste Constantijn Huygensstraat.

You've been waiting for the light to turn green, you cross the intersection, and then as soon as you're on the other side there's a zebra crossing. Not only is it frustrating to have to slow down after you've just picked up speed, it's often so busy that if you were to yield, all the cyclists behind you would be stuck on the road (or crash into you). It just makes no sense to have zebra crossings here.

travel,"Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels, Vienna, or Zurich","I am planning a trip for April 2026 of approximately 2 weeks in length. I currently have an itinerary of Rome-Barcelona. On a previous trip to Europe we visited Prague (liked), Paris (didn’t like), Florence (liked), Rome (liked).  I have previously been to Copenhagen as well, which I enjoyed. My SO spent quite a bit of time in Switzerland 30+ years ago, but I’ve not been.

We talked about going back to Rome someday, hence the current itinerary. However, this is going to be only our second trip to Europe as a couple (first trip was >10 years ago) and we don’t get to travel to Europe very often. We also have a friend in London that we’d like to visit so I am considering replacing Rome with another city to see other parts of Europe and adding London, and would like some advice on which city to possibly substitute.

About us:
- We prefer not to move hotels too often, so we want to be in a city 3-5 full days and move at a more relaxed pace
- we like food, culture, and museums (art and national history, not the more niche ones like spy museums etc). A museum visit will likely take most of our day unless it’s really small
- walking yes biking no
- Hyatt globalist and Marriott Platinum, but could really use the nights for Hyatt so that would be my strong preference 

I am building an alternate itinerary to bring up with my SO. Between Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels, Vienna, and Zurich, which one should I add to London and Barcelona, and what makes you say that?

cycling,My optimism roads (at least in France),"I am happy to say some parts of France are moving in a good direction. What percentage I don’t know but I see this in Southern France around the Mougins-Nice area.

Multiple sections, lanes or sub lanes on each road.

\- One for pedestrians

\- One for bicyles and escooters under a certain speed

\- The road for motor vehicles are to be shared with motorbikes (usually on the left side of the lane) and fast going performance cyclists or commuters on ebikes (ideally on the right side of the lane so we can slow down and go into the slower bike lane when necessary or vice versa) or fast going e-scooters.

\- One road lane for public transport, taxis, emergency usage. I think cycling teams can officially use this segment but I’m not sure. Of course they would not have the right of the way if an ambulance is coming.

This setup misses one group: runners. They often use the right side of the bike lane if the sidewalk is crowded. Overall I’m quite happy here except the tourists who drive cars. They really drive bad particularly in the Cannes area.

One hardship is vehicle parking. The (motorcar) lanes are in the middle of the road and so car/motorbike parking has to be between the bike lanes and the sidewalk. Handling this complexity in a city that’s 100 to 500+ years old and has narrow roads is much tougher because one has to account so many other things such as road signaling, city lighting, passive road safety measures, public transportation, tree roots and so on.

I think urban road design is among the toughest topics there is and the French are really good at it.

Do you like your roads, do you see an improvement in terms of design? I remember watching a very nice you tube channel called not just bikes. Learned a lot from his videos.

Could you also tell me which city is the best in your view? I’d like to go there for a bike vacation. Amsterdam I know and like (great place to be in the heat of the summer) but perhaps there is another city out there...

Netherlands,Bike shipping from Netherlands to Spain,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for advice from people who have experience shipping bikes internationally.

Here’s my situation: I currently live in Valencia (Spain), and my old bike was lost during the floods here last October. A friend of mine in Amsterdam has an extra Dutch-style bike (omafiets) that she’s willing to give me. Since I spent a few months in Amsterdam years ago and really appreciated the build quality of Dutch bikes, I’d love to bring this one over.

Back then, when I finished my stay in Amsterdam, I brought my bike back by checking it in on my flight. It cost me around €60–70 in total (including the airline fee and a cardboard bike box I bought at the airport). This time, though, I need to send the bike on its own, and I’m not sure what’s the most practical way to ship it from the Netherlands to Spain.

I’ve read a bit about specialized services (like BikeFlights, SendMyBag, etc.) as well as standard couriers (UPS/DHL/DPD), but I’m confused about costs, packaging requirements, and reliability. I know Dutch bikes are pretty heavy (around 20 kg) and large, so I imagine shipping can get complicated or expensive.

Have any of you shipped a bike across Europe before? The bike is fairly old, so I wouldn’t mind dismantling it and reassembling it once it arrives. Any advice or experiences would be greatly appreciated!

I’ve looked at the Eurostar, but it’s a bit of a headache. To take a fully assembled bike, we’d need to travel from Amsterdam to Brussels and then get the Eurostar from Brussels to London. That said, bike bookings are currently a nightmare – you need to seek approval to book a bike spot, but they’re not taking bookings at the moment due to a booking system upgrade. They do accept walk-ins, but that feels super risky as not all services accept bikes, and there’s four of us!

The other option is the ferry from Hook of Holland to Harwich, but that feels like a lot of faff – both in terms of time and cost.

One idea I’ve had is to disassemble the bikes, put them in bike boxes (or cardboard bike boxes), and either fly back or take the Eurostar from Amsterdam as normal, checking the bikes as luggage. The problem is – where can we easily get bike boxes in Amsterdam?

My destination will be Amsterdam, and I won't be bringing the bike home with me so are there places in Amsterdam I could donate the bike?

biketouring,Just finished my first tour - 8500km through 15 countries in Europe,"I caught a lot of inspiration and advice off this subreddit before setting off so thought i'd share my trip in the hope it inspires others!

* I'm from New Zealand and I figured this was the cheapest way to explore the continent. 
* Started in Dublin and finished in Madrid, riding 8500km through 15 countries in between. 
* As a road cycling fan I planned it so I could watch both the Tour de France and Vuelta a Espana and ride as many famous climbs as I could (esp. in the Alps and Pyrenees). 
* I vinyl-wrapped my bike blue and orange (fav colours) which proved a great icebreaker and started a numerous convos with curious passers-by.
* I broke up the riding to keep the enthusiasm levels high and keep fresh. My girlfriend was backpacking Europe at the time so we met up 4 times throughout the trip (London, Amsterdam, Greece, and Switzerland).
* Accommodation: ~40% freedom camping/ 40% paid campgrounds/ 15% hostels, AirBnB, family/ 5% Warmshowers
* Longest day riding: 340km from Portuguese coast to Salamanca

I recently secured an internship in Amsterdam. The office is, however, 9.3km away and thus a 35 minute bike ride.

That being said, it would be a matter of when I get fined, not if.

The company offers me 20 euros worth of SwapFiets subscription. I can choose whichever package. Thus I am torn between 2 options: the premium standard bike (with 7 gears, cheaper if it gets stolen) that would thus be free, or the E-bike model 1 which would bring me to 25 Euros/month. However, the costs of the repairs in case of the battery damage or theft are scary af.

I come from a very nice part of northern Italy, where I have always had plenty of climbs and beautiful routes right from my doorstep, there was always a new PR to set on a local climb or descent.
Last year I moved to Amsterdam and although I am really appreciating the active cycling community and the safety of bike lanes around the country, I am really struggling with the flatness and the never-changing scenery (canals-grass fields-cows-windmills).
I am finding some motivation in group rides and in crit races, as I am also missing the amazing granfondo events I was used to take part during summers.
I am now finding myself hopping on the indoor trainer as I sometimes find it worthless to go out and cycle the route I already know it’s gonna bore me.
I was wondering if anyone has experienced something similar and found something that sparked their passion for this beautiful sport again!

Netherlands,Help Choosing a 3.5-Day Family-Friendly Biking Route in the Netherlands (Kids 6 & 9),"
Hi everyone!

I’m planning a 3.5-day biking tour in the Netherlands in May with my two kids (6 and 9 years old) and want to choose a route that will be both manageable and entertaining for them. I’d love to hear from those who have cycled these areas or traveled with kids!

Here are the three options I’m considering:

Option 1 
	•	Day 1: Haarlem → Zaandam → Zaanse Schans 
	•	Day 2: Zaandam → Monnickendam → Volendam 
	•	Day 3: Volendam → Hoorn 
	•	Day 4 (half-day): Hoorn → Alkmaar

Option 2 
	•	Day 1: Haarlem → Zandvoort → Haarlem 
	•	Day 2: Haarlem → Heemskerk 
	•	Day 3: Heemskerk → Wijk aan Zee → Castricum aan Zee → Heemskerk 
	•	Day 4 (half-day): Heemskerk → Amsterdam 

Option 3 
	•	Day 1: Zoetermeer → Wassenaar → Noordwijk aan Zee (beach & dunes)
	•	Day 2: Noordwijk aan Zee → Leiden → Zoetermeer 
       . Day 3 and 4?

Option 4:
        . Day 1: Zandvoort - Noordwijk
        . Day 2: Noordwijk - Leiden - Katwijk
        . Day 3: Katwijk - Delft
        . Day 4: Delft - Rotterdam

What I’m Looking For:
	•	A mix of fun and engaging stops for kids (playgrounds, short attractions, rest areas)
	•	Manageable daily distances for young riders (~30-40km max per day)
	•	Backup options (like trains or ferries) in case the kids get too tired
	•	Less exposure to strong winds or long, monotonous stretches

If you’ve done any of these routes—or have other recommendations—I’d love to hear your thoughts! Which would be the most fun for kids? Are there any must-see stops or hidden gems along the way? Or do you another ideas?

Thanks in advance!

Routes I would regularly take shouldn't take me through a giant chunk of the city first, and they shouldn't be littered with annoyances (i.e. they should be routes I can bike at a decent peace consistently without being interrupted too often).

My wife and I are both graduate students from the U.S., and we spontaneously decided to book a trip to Amsterdam since our winter breaks aligned this year. This is both our first time out of the U.S., and we have done some research into what there is to do, where we can go, etc., but nothing too specific. We would like this trip to be more frugal, as we have already spent a lot on the flights and hotel.

We will be in Amsterdam for 5 full days, and we have a broad idea of what we could do:

1. Take a train to Cologne, Germany, or Brussels, Belgium (contingent on the price of the train tickets)

Which is better for the price and things to do? We already looked at a general idea of what there is to do in both areas, but if you can provide specifics, that'd be great! Also, which train station would we use to go between countries?

2. Visit a few national parks (Veluwezoom, Posbank, Zuid-kennermerland)

If there are any other parks or sightseeing places worth visiting, please let us know!

3. Museums

Other than the Red Light/prostitution museums, maybe some that have traditional art that have a free/cheap entry fee?

4. Restaurants/Food

My wife and I are big foodies and love to try new food. If you can recommend restaurants or cafes/bakeries that are a must, please do! We aren't too picky, and we would prefer places that are no more than €20-30 per person.

5. Bike around the city

We haven't explored bike rental options much, but what would be the most affordable option? Is it safe to bike in the winter?

In general, are there any cultural expectations that we should be aware of?

I apologize for the lengthy post, but I am quite nervous about traveling to a foreign country without someone with experience.

travel,Rate my itinerary! Netherlands and Belgium,"Hi all!

I have a question regarding my itinerary. **I will go to the Netherlands and Belgium in Autumn.**

We are a young couple looking for a vacation, going to do *both chill and some fun activities* as well. We have 7 whole days, arriving in Amsterdam on the first night and leaving from Brussels Zaventem. *We also plan to rent a bike* since we like outdoor sports and we're used to training. We aim to be in the center so we can go to coffee shops or the red light district anytime, it isn't our most favourite activity, but we will definitely try. We don't need to pack all of our days--at least while in Amsterdam, since we also try to chill.

This is my planned itinerary:

* \*- Day 0: Arrive at midnight to the hotel and get some sleep to start at dawn.
* Day 1: Walk through Amsterdam, do a free walking tour, go to some coffee shops and stuff.
* Day 2: Go to Zaanse Schans using a bike.
* Day 3: Vondelpark (or any that you might recommend) and Magic ~~shrooms~~ Stuff -- get some pints after.
* Day 4: Rotterdam/Eindhoven.
* Day 5: Free day to do whatever. Last night on Amsterdam.
* Day 6: Go to brussels at midday, then go to our hotel in Ghent at dusk and enjoy the night in the city.
* Day 7: Brugges and Ghent. Last night.
* Day 8: Leaving at midday, so taking the train to Zavendem in the morning.

What do you think? We don't want to spend a lot of time in Brussels since I know the place and I'm more eager to visit Brugges and Ghent. We don't want to be moving from place to place every day, hence we aim to only use Amsterdam and Ghent as a base.

**Paris > Strasbourg > Lyon > Nice > Amsterdam** 

**📍Paris (2 nights)**

* Arriving from CDG, staying near Gare de l’Est
* Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, bakery hopping (La Maison Rose, Du Pain et des Idées, Carette)
* Walking Champs-Élysées, grabbing dinner near Saint-Émilion
* Not doing Louvre or Versailles — keeping it scenic and food-focused

**📍Strasbourg (3 nights)**

* Day trip to Colmar (return by train)
* Petite France, Place Kléber, local winstubs, cathedral
* Trying local bakeries and chill walks around the riverside
* Staying near the station

**📍Lyon (3 nights)**

* Bouchon dinner (Les Lyonnais), and another at Carmelo
* May do the 2-hour e-bike tour if the weather’s nice
* Exploring Vieux Lyon, traboules, Parc de la Tête d’Or, and checking out Presqu’île
* Staying fairly central

**📍Nice (3 nights)**

* Promenade des Anglais, flower market, beach strolls
* One day trip to Eze, plus a walk up to the Jardin Exotique
* Food will be light and local — socca, seafood, pastries

**📍Amsterdam (4 nights)**

* Exploring the city by tram and foot
* Anne Frank House, Keukenhof, and a half-day out to Zaandam + Zaanse Schans
* Cafés like Lanskroon, Fabel Friet, Winkel 43

cycling,Fixie or freewheel-single speed?,"TLDR: I need a new bike. I want it to be reliable,  low-maintenance, and nukeproof (not necessarily the brand, lol)

So today I had a pretty rough crash in the 
middle of Amsterdam because once again my city bike broke. I didn't do anything crazy -I got out of the saddle, pushed on the paddles, and my freewheel broke at over 30kmph, so I went straight over the bars. This time it could've ended up in me under a car.

As I went flying towards the pavement, the voice in my head went something like ""_sigh_ here we go again"" -it was the third time I crashed because a bike gave out.

Yes, I do put them through a fair bit of abuse -I'm 100kg, I'm a fit cyclist, put quite a bit of power in, do tricks etc. I don't want to crash because of a bike breaking again.

Is it affordable (perhaps more so than buying a 'normal' 2nd hand bike) to buy a fixie, single-speed with a freewheel, or something similar, or DIY it? I want my next bike to be Rik-proof and have a sporty geometry akin to my roadbike or mountainbike, so I'll be faster, and it should have low maintenance- no shimano nexus nonsense, just things I can mostly fix and maintain myself.

Does anyone have any recommendations on what to do? I'm writing this at night worried about some things and with pain in my hip, so excuse the lack of layout.

Many thanks!

Edit: so I'm mostly pondering about a single speed, but with free wheel and brakes. I'm trying to figure out where to look for a frame and components that won't break the bank. I'll need a solid aluminium or steel frame with a mount suitable for shimano 105 or ultegra rim brakes (disc brakes wouldn't be worth it, considering the bike will be outside a lot).",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/1jfcchm/fixie_or_freewheelsingle_speed/,1742430496.0,9,Amsterdam bike,search,2025-03-20 00:28:16

biketouring,Have frame bags replaced panniers?,"Friends- 

I'm researching like crazy for the build for my first ever touring / dirt touring bike. On a lot of blogs, Instagrams and bike packing sites I've notice a lot of people are opting for a series of smaller frame bags over panniers. 

Has anyone here done this? Is this just a matter of people being trendy? Is there any advantage to an all frame/bar/seat bag setup?

bikecommuting,Folding bike advice,"I have been researching electric folding bikes because I cycle a lot and don't own a car – even in rain, wind, and throughout the winter. I also regularly visit my parents in the Harz mountains, where it is hilly.
I am relatively skilled with my hands and can repair almost everything myself, except for electronics problems, a frame fracture, or precise wheel truing. Mechanical add-on components are not a problem for me.
For a folding bike, good modifiability would be important to me – meaning, for example, that I can swap out the front chainring for a larger one, as well as the handlebars, saddle, cassette, or rear derailleur (almost no folding bike has a clutch derailleur). A standard MTB stem would also be ideal, although I have only found one model so far that offers this.
The components should ideally be standard parts so that they are easily available and cheap to replace. A derailleur system is a must – I worry about damaging a hub gear, I don't want to deal with that topic, and while a Gates belt drive is interesting, it is more expensive to purchase and replace. I have been very satisfied with chain and chain wax so far, also in terms of durability. Also because I can more easily increase the gear range compared to a hub gear.

I have no need for the bike to fold particularly quickly or compactly, and weight is not a major factor for me – even 35 kg would not be a problem. I have had heavier e-bikes before. The main thing is that it rides well and I don't have to pay a ticket on the regional train(in Germany every day with a bike coat 7€, for my trips it's around 50€ in month and maybe even more, if I always ride with the bike). I would have also considered an e-scooter, but those are banned in many urban public transport systems due to the low quality of the components, and I don't want to buy a device only to find out in a few months/years that I can no longer take it on the regional train.
I have found various models in the meantime, but none has convinced me 100% yet.

1. Engwe L20 3.0 Pro (China model)
   
Almost perfect – but it has a freewheel in combination with a 100 Nm motor, which is also a proprietary development (Mivice X700, not Bafang copy). Therefore, unfortunately not an option, even if the price and features were (almost) ideal.

2. Cube Fold Hybrid 500
   
Nice design, 500 Wh battery, and it would be the only new model with a guarantee at a fair price, because there is even a newer Fold with a 545 Wh battery.

Disadvantages: The front chainring is Bosch proprietary. Many e-bikes are not designed for pedalling along at higher speeds – above about 28-30 km/h you spin out. I have found BCD-104 adapters for the Bosch Gen 3 motor, but whether they really fit in terms of chainline and durability is questionable. I would prefer not to order a bike only to send it back because of a non-fitting adapter – that's simply too much hassle.
The warranty situation is also unclear: No dealer in Hanover carries this model, probably because it is already ""outdated"". Would every Cube dealer handle potential problems? In principle, I would only use the service for major damage such as frame breakage or electronic defects – I take care of minor things like rubbing brakes or loose screws myself.

3. Tern Vektron S10 (refurbished)

This model is now sold, but it was almost perfect: strong Bosch Performance motor, large luggage rack, 500 Wh battery, detachable chainring.

Disadvantages: The price for a used bike, in my opinion, is too high, €2700, and it's a 2021 model, and I would only rate the design 4/10 – especially in relation to the price.

4. Velodeville KES 400 (refurbished)
   
Also an interesting model – with a normal MTB stem and handlebars, and significantly cheaper than a Tern, €1700, and also a detachable chainring. The design is so-so, and the available colour in orange is like a construction worker's garbage disposal vehicle, but it costs correspondingly less.

Disadvantages: The battery is slightly smaller at 400 Wh than other models, the Shimano E6100 motor is rated worse by some than the Bosch Active (as installed in the Cube), and when folded, the bike looks quite large. I wonder if train conductors would accept it as luggage.

travel,"Please help finalise 3-week Northern Europe itinerary (Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Norway, Finland/Sweden, Estonia)","Hi all,

My partner and I are planning a 3-week trip from Australia to Northern Europe in June–July 2026. We’re flying in via Doha and currently working out the itinerary. Here’s what we have so far:

* **Amsterdam – 2 nights** (easiest flights from Australia to Northern-ish Europe)
* **Copenhagen – 1 night** (happy with just a taste)
* **Norway** – for fjords and dramatic hikes
* **Finland or Sweden** – can only choose one as pressed for time, open to advice
* **Estonia** – to balance the trip with Baltic charm and affordability

# About us & preferences:

* Nature lovers: we love hiking, biking, lakes, forests, fjords, and waterfalls.
* We prefer breathtaking, unique landscapes over repetitive or less impressive ones.
* We are considering hiring a car for travel for flexibility (depending on costs, ease of travel etc)
* We’re on a budget (don’t want to spend an arm and a leg), but we’ll spend when it’s truly worth it.
* Interested in some cultural experiences too (Midsummer traditions, old towns, folk festivals, food).
* Not keen on moving every single day — prefer to base ourselves for 3–5 nights in fewer spots.

# Questions for the group:

1. If we have to choose between Sweden and Finland, which gives us the best balance of unique scenery, culture, and budget-friendliness?
2. How would you suggest reorganising the itinerary to minimise flight/train/ferry costs and redundancy, given our start in Amsterdam and finish back to Australia?
3. Any “don’t miss” spots in Norway, Estonia, Finland/Sweden that would suit our hiking/nature focus?
4. Is 1 night in Copenhagen enough, or should we stretch it?
5. Anything you’d recommend adding, dropping, or swapping to make the most of this trip?

Hello everyone, I’m a German student who has just started studying in Vienna. Unfortunately, a situation has arisen earlier than expected: my Dutch grandfather is dying in a hospital in my hometown in Germany. Unfortunately, due to compulsory events at university, I won't be able to get there until Thursday night, by which time he will most likely already be gone. I’m planning to get a tattoo on Friday to remind me of him. As he’s Dutch and the culture was always part of our special connection, I want to get a “Dutch-style” tattoo. As I’m in my early twenties and all my other tattoos are artistic interpretations of traditional tattoos, I'd like to avoid anything too corny. He’s from Delft, and the rest of my family are from Amsterdam or Rotterdam, if that helps with ideas. Are there any symbols linked to the Netherlands that aren't too obvious, such as tulips, bikes and windmills?

travel,For anyone who has been to Amsterdam: What are the biking and pedestrian cultural rules?!? How do I cross the zebra lanes or roads?,"I know I sound like a stupid tourist, but I have been to Amsterdam three times and still don’t know how to cross the roads without a crosswalk sign. I’ve never been hit by a bike or a tram because I try to be careful. Naturally I stop at any crosswalk and look both ways. I know the pedestrians have the right of way, but I never expect anyone to stop. Today I got yelled at for not crossing fast enough. For context, my friend in front of me crossed without looking and almost got crashed into. Naturally, I stop before crossing the zebra lanes after seeing that. Then a bike person on the right stops for me and keeps telling me to go while bikes are still coming on my left. The bikes on my left were going fast af so I still waited for those people to stop and didn’t go. Then she screams “EVERY BIKE HAS STOPPED FOR YOU. IF YOU ARE ON THE SIDEWALK, YOU NEED TO GO!!” Which shocked me because I let bikes go first since they have a harder time breaking and they go at the goddamn speed of light sometimes. It was just one second I waited but in my mind, I felt like I needed to wait because I didn’t expect any of the bikes to stop for me and they usually never have. Anyways I’m confused on the traffic rules and how to not get into a crash while also not stopping too long for bikes. This is a genuine question because I don’t know how to approach bikes and roads. Do I just keep walking anyways when I think it’s good to go and then suddenly a bike is turning at the speed of light towards me? I usually freeze because I think im gonna get hit.

Netherlands,Please Influence/De-Influence My Family's Upcoming Netherlands Trip,"Hello everyone! My family and I (husband and our two kids- ages 3 and 7) are coming the first week of November to explore, learn about the country and culture, and consider a potential move. With that in mind, we're hoping to equally balance seeing the sights and having fun, while also getting a taste for what every day life is like. Some important points:

\-We will be staying in Amsterdam, but hope to branch out most days to other cities to get a feel for places that would be more likely for us to settle.

\-We plan to have breakfast at our hotel, explore stores and markets during the day for lunch, and then visit a restaurant most evenings for dinner.

\-We'd like to get a feel for what it's like to travel around locally, do grocery shopping, visit parks, and anything else a family might need to do. So we'll likely be doing a lot of walking and maybe some biking to truly get a feel and stop at places along the way between activities.

Our current itinerary is loosely this:

Monday: Arrive in Amsterdam and do whatever we have to in order to beat the jet lag. Maybe grab a meal nearby the hotel.

Tuesday: Anne Frank House followed by Tony's Chocolonely (Chocolatemakers is already booked up for our dates). Maybe Vondelpark and/or canal tour if weather allows. A museum (like Van Gogh or Rijksmuseum) if we're up for it and have time.

Wednesday: Head to Utrecht. Railway Museum, Dom Tower, and maybe some shopping

Thursday: The Hague. Check out Boulevard Scheveningen.  Louwman Museum, maybe see a movie

Friday: Leiden. Leiden Castle and Naturalis Biodiversity Center, maybe a(nother) canal tour?

Saturday: Back in Amsterdam. The kids seemed excited about the all you can eat pancake boat tour we heard about. NEMO Science Museum

Does this sound doable for an American family who's never been before and who's coming in the fall? Are we missing anything? Should we swap out cities? Haarlem, Eindhoven, and Rotterdam were also on our lists but what I have here was what I found online that seemed most likely to keep young kids engaged. Any grocery stores or markets you recommend over others? Any particularly family-friendly restaurants we should try?

urbanplanning,"""Left Nimbyism"" has to be the most misused slur in all of Pop-Urbanism. Here's a debunking of this claim & an explanation of Left Urbanist theory from the POV of an actual Left Urbanist","#Hello, I'm /u/DoxiadisOfDetroit , mod of /r/left_urbanism , and Left Urbanist theorist micro-celebrity here on Reddit. I'm making this post today in order to reach those of you out there who are in between Left Urbanism and YIMBYism but, don't identify with one title or, the other. There's been a real push in my POV to demonize any anti-capitalist perspectives in the field of Urbanism and, in it's place embrace the more pro-market YIMBY perspective.

#Since this is a wildly controversial topic to do a deep dive on, I will only engage with good faith criticism (I've spent way too many days on subs like /r/urbanplanning attempting to argue against bad faith criticism of my posts, only to be accused of being a bad faith actor myself. So, if you come to this piece with unfounded/ignorant takes, all your gonna get outta me is a small paragraph about your flawed argument and a block).

#Finally, there will be a series of TL;DRs within the post to get the general gist of what arguments are being made, and, to make this contribution easy to navigate at a glance. The structure of this post is intentional and seeks to facilitate general conversation among subs that have a pro YIMBY bias (such as /r/yimby , /r/neoliberal , /r/badeconomics , city subs, etc.).

# Part One: Clipping the Wing Off of a YIMBY Icarus, OhTheUrbanity's Intentional Ignorance and the miss-use of ""Left NIMBYism"" as a Slur

To accomplish what I seek to do with this post, I need a foil to use in order to distinguish what the Left Urbanist perspective is, and, illustrate the bad faith critiques that have been lobbed at this political orientation. Luckily for me, the husband and wife duo of Canadian youtuber Urbanists (OhTheUrbanity) have [recently made a video to illustrate to their ~104k subscribers what they feel constitutes the ideology of ""Left NIMBYism""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvTa-GXKxak). I've gone over the video multiple times and have taken notes. All of their core arguments are timestamped and I will go over them as they appear in the video:

> [[00:22](https://youtu.be/tvTa-GXKxak?t=22)] This video is about Left wing NIMBYism. ""Not In My Back Yard"" opposition to new housing that appeals to language of affordability and inclusivity or skepticism of markets and Capitalism.The basic idea is that market rate housing, especially expensive new builds, doesn't help the housing crisis and might even hurt. Real affordability comes from social, or, non-profit housing, mandating affordability in private projects, and rent control on existing units.

So, the beginning of this video seeks to sum up the ""Left NIMBY"" perspective which, OhTheUrbanity simply paints in broad strokes as a vaguely anti-Capitalist perspective on urban development. I'll get into what I'd describe Left Urbanism is in the next portion of this post, so, I'll save my response to this point for last, moving on:

> [[01:26](https://youtu.be/tvTa-GXKxak?t=86)] A more fleshed out example of Left wing NIMBYism is the article: '[The Supply and Demand Myth of Housing](https://canadiandimension.com/articles/view/the-supply-and-demand-myth-of-housing)', which claims what we build and for whom matters more than how much we build. It argues that prices are mainly driven by ""commodification"". Which, they seem to mean whether housing is for profit versus off the market, with supply being, at best, a secondary factor. To be clear, supporting social or non-profit housing, is not itself, ""NIMBYism"". What's NIMBY is when this is unnecessarily paired with opposing or dismissing Market Rate housing.

It's this first example which shows OhTheUrbanity's ignorance on the subject. Basically what they're doing here is an unjust framing of the conversations surrounding what counts as an acceptable Urbanist point of view. To them, it's only a valid opinion for Left Urbanists to have if they see Market Rate housing as a tool to affect the housing market, any other opinion, or, the rejection of Market Rate development as a means to tame housing prices permanently is seen as ""unacceptable"" or wrong. ***On top of this just being a perspective centered upon [what theorists on the Left such as Mark Fisher call ""Capitalist Realism""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDKIjyFYNM), this is essentially like saying that only deciduous forests  can exist when someone proposes planting trees in the Sahel to stop desertification. If we know that forests can be made up of fundamentally different components, and we entrust scientists and academics to study those components, we can do the same for housing.***

This is also a perfect example of OhTheUrbanity's ideological bias because in the article that he references 1) raises valid issues of the ""just build more housing"" dogmatism of YIMBYism by bringing up greenbelts, [REITs and the monopoly AI software they use to pursue price manipulation on the market](https://canadiandimension.com/articles/view/the-reit-ification-of-housing), as well as the flawed valorization of ""mom and pop"" landlords, and, 2) The word ""commodification"" occurs six times within the article, the very first time that it's used, it's cited within the word ""decommodification"", which was used to highlight how, even though France and Canada have similar housing pressures, rents are drastically cheaper in France than they are in Canada. Namely, because the French government has enacted strict mandates for municipalities to follow in order to meet non-market housing quotas and doles out steep fines if they aren't met ([YIMBYs have repeatedly called for the higher-end state control/federalization of zoning powers](https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/1n19jqe/zoning_isnt_the_only_thing_holding_back_housing/) just as what's happened in Japan, which is basically a Market Urbanist approach to this issue. This would do nothing other than institutionally entrench pro developer lobbying into government institutions more than already exist now because of SCOTUS' ruling on corporate personhood/money in politics. But, in fairness to them, this creator is from Canada so, I guess they'll have to wait for the speedrun of the Canadian version of Citizen's United in the SCC). Anyways, there's still a lot to analyze:

> [[02:10](https://youtu.be/tvTa-GXKxak?t=130)] The idea that building housing somehow adds pressure to the housing market, rather than taking pressure off. That's a ""Not In My Back Yard"" anti-housing attitude

This small portion right here is such great proof of OhTheUrbanity's rhetorical dishonesty about this topic. The very same video that they dub over literally contradicts their own assumptions about ""Left NIMBYism"". ***The full context that they intentionally left out because it was too inconvenient was that the clip was from a local Montreal news channel interviewing a housing advocate trying to get the city's government to double the amount of Social Housing over 15 years, which would've broken down to ~10k new units of Social Housing each year.*** The clip of the newscast that OhTheUrbanity included in their video description literally gives their reasoning as well:

> [***""It's clear that if nothing happens and if nothing changes \[the housing market\] is gonna be worse and worse and we already acknowledge the fact that there's a doubling of people living outside and that's directly linked by the housing crisis""***](https://youtu.be/H-V7GUSiWtQ?t=48).

If your average Market Urbanist YIMBY were to be believed, Left Urbanists outright reject that there is even a housing crisis at all, and yet, when one of those Market Urbanist YIMBYs is faced with a Left Urbanist who's informed about the issues in their city and suggests an alternative path forward for their government, they're straw manned in order to try and discredit them and described as ""anti housing"" because they don't support expensive Market Rate housing. They also refuse to realize that, if the housing market is regularly churning out Market Rate studios and single bedrooms instead of providing housing for families, Capitalist development literally is putting pressure on those units because they're more scarce, not to mention that individual cities doing zoning deregulation won't do anything outside of metropolitan-wide coordination.

> [[02:18](https://youtu.be/tvTa-GXKxak?t=138)] The article makes mistakes, like ""debunking"" supply and demand by saying that Calgary had faster rent growth than Edmonton despite having similar vacancy rates. But, the report it cites from Canada's federal housing authority very, clearly, states, that more supply reduces pressure on rents. The article cherrypicks two cities recently and ignores the broader trend: Over a 25 year period, low vacancy equals high rent growth, high vacancy equals low rent growth.

In this portion of the video, they try to use a study to ""support their argument"", despite the fact that, when they literally show the data contained within the Canadian housing study covering the Western Canadian cities, Calgary sticks out like a bent nail because it's it's an obvious outlier among the ""high vacancy-low rent growth"" cities despite suffering from a similar amount of rent growth to Regina, which is categorized as ""low vacancy-high rent growth"". This reminds me of a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/yimby/comments/1mp0o7c/what_sources_would_debunk_these_claims/) on /r/yimby that I saw where the OP was basically crowdsourcing responses for why certain metros were suffering from a HCOL while also having high vacancy rates. The top comment rationalized that everything was fine, actually, because the all of their rents were either stagnating or decreasing, which, according to them, vindicated YIMBY policy [despite the fact that permits are down across the country especially in YIMBY ""success story"" cities](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4486921-housing-starts-rise-more-than-expected-in-july-but-building-permits-dip) that've went through broad housing deregulation, so, there won't be any market forces continually pushing rents further downwards since developments don't pencil. To add to the confusion around this topic for Market Urbanist YIMBYs, OhTheUrbanity includes this blurb on the video to make sure we don't know what to actually think about vacancy rates:

> ""The article says that vacancy rates don't correlate with prices across countries, but countries calculate vacancy differently, so I'm not sure that national vacancy rates are comparable. More importantly, I think that shortages are best understood at the city,regional level. In the US, NYC has an enormous shortage, Buffalo? Not so much"".

So, the graph that they're trying to debunk deals with the OECD countries and their housing price indexes compared to their national vacancy rates, which doesn't show any correlation. Of the total 38 member nations of the OECD, the graph only shows 8 of them (which, I'll assume are the most ""developed"" of them). Instead of diving into what countries categorize which properties as vacant, OhTheUrbanity decides to sidestep contrary data by simply casting doubt upon the graph rather than interacting with it's findings. Gee, I wonder what the acronym ""OECD"" stands for and what is the goal between it's member nations, I guess we don't have to suffer a 8 second google search to figure out the graph, because according to OhTheUrbanity, it's irrelevant.

They then top their ""rebuttal"" of the data off by suggesting that the nation's largest, wealthiest, and densest metro area has more housing demand than a post-industrial metro with none of the same characteristics. I'm convinced now, aren't the rest of you guys?

> [[02:49](https://youtu.be/tvTa-GXKxak?t=169)] Left NIMBYism is amplified in the mainstream media, a CBC article quotes activists saying that Montreal's Griffintown was overrun by condos that do nothing to curb housing shortages. Claiming that housing for 25k people does nothing to curb housing shortages, just because most of it is Market Rate, is plainly and clearly absurd

In the world of real estate, there are only two classes of people: buyers and sellers. ***Simply showing what hoops buyers have to jump through in order to obtain the frivolous luxury of having a place of their own does not constitute media bias***. But, lets get to the actual meat of their rebuttal: Here, OhTheUrbanity is suggesting that the current mode of housing development comprised primarily of Market Rate units has utility because it houses a certain amount of people, and, cities need people, and, people need housing, so, to them, the usefulness of a neighborhood like Griffintown is self-evident. Here's where a little bit of Left Urbanist theory is needed in order to fully understand the other side of the story: 

A Left Urbanist would argue that the utility of housing development/place making comes from allowing the working class, middle class, and the rich to intermix in the same neighborhoods no matter what their income is, and that has amenities accessible to them all without financial barriers or even, creating public spaces for them/amenities that don't cost anything whatsoever. Shops may have select high priced items reserved for the wealthy few, but, the majority of the populace is able to comfortably live within the ideal Left Urbanist neighborhood. OhTheUrbanity linked a reddit comment [within a wider thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/lkp21x/griffintown_represents_the_potential_of_urban/) on the /r/montreal sub that was discussing the ""potential"" of Griffintown, and, the top comment here is a perfect example of one of the main Left Urbanist critiques of Urban development under Capitalism. They basically suggest that, while they personally enjoyed living in the neighborhood as a single bachelor, they put doubt on the idea that Griffintown could become anything other than a transitional neighborhood that'll primarily be occupied by upwardly mobile 20 somethings and not families or people of a working class background.

***Griffintown is a great example of how Capitalist development produces ""monoculture neighborhoods"" that mimic the traits of great Urbanist neighborhoods but are too soulless and ""corporate"" to have the same success.*** Here in Metro Detroit, we have a couple of places just like Griffintown, the biggest ones that come to mind are Royal Oak and Ann Arbor, both of those cities are the most expensive municipalities to live in within the state of Michigan, yet, their gentrification has made them shadows of the truly egalitarian Urbanist spaces they used to be, I specifically call Royal Oak ""a gentrifier's idea of a cool city"" because there's literally nothing unique about it. 

I once walked around downtown Royal Oak trying to do some ""man on the street"" interviews for a project that I was working on, despite the fact that it was a Friday evening and there were a fair bit of people walking around, literally no one stopped to talk to me, I'm not timid at all, and I have a voice that is able to carry through softer noises, despite addressing everyone as warmly as I attempted to, this group of guys in polo shirts and khaki shorts looked at me like I had nipples on my forehead. I've only ever passed through downtown Ann Arbor to go other places, but literally every other month there's a slew of longtime stores/community staples that get priced out of the retail market. Contrast this with NYC, which is a great Urbanist city because the people are actually willing to strike up a conversation and you have no idea what's gonna come outta their mouths, it's small things like that which makes a community stand out more than just being a location, ***Capitalist development pushes sterility onto the urban form, that's why you can have walkable communities without actually having Urbanism or an organic sense of community***.

> [[03:10](https://youtu.be/tvTa-GXKxak?t=190)] At it's core, Left NIMBYism misunderstands prices. What is a price? Among other things, a price is a way to ration scarcity. [...] Left NIMBYism treats prices as a trick, a mirage of Capitalism, rather than a reflection of an underlying material reality. If we could just take a hammer and smash those prices down, we'd fix the problem.

Now, we arrive at the point of no return for those of you who may be leaning more towards the Left Urbanist side of things. Because I fundamentally believe in materialist analysis, I'll suggest that most of you have developed your political/economic beliefs because of your personal experiences as I have, and there's a comically easy rebuttal that can be offered to this patronizing and facetious point: If anyone has ever worked in retail, you'd understand that prices are, quite literally fictitious. At my job, we have a tool that tells us what it costs to make a product, and what the ""retail price"" of it is. Let's say that a customer is highly dissatisfied with the customer service that they receive at the store, SOP at a retail store more often than not is to literally offer them a coupon or a price reduction on their purchase. Of course, a manager would have to sign off on it but it's literally an example of the rate of profit being a completely arbitrary concept. Not only that ***Left Urbanists understand that Capitalism actually enforces scarcity***. [There's been attempted ""debunkings""](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/musne8/disproving_the_vacant_homes_myth/) of the issue that there are more vacant units than there are homeless people, with one of the main critiques being that ""the available units aren't where the people are"". Which, by that logic, means that there is no hunger within so-called ""developed"" nations such as the US or UK because you have an abundance of boujie grocery stores in places like DUMBO and Croydon while the food deserts on the Eastside of Detroit or in Blackpool are irrelevant. If we know that under our current mode of production that there is immense food waste being produced for elastic goods such as perishable food, we can also assume that with the wide gap between homelessness and housing vacancies within an inelastic commodity such as housing need, this is also a direct result of Capitalism's waste and contradictions.

Before I move on, it has to be said that the counterargument that I just put forward is a ***anticapitalist*** counterargument, not a ***Marxist*** counterargument. For those who have actually read Marx, they'd tell you that Marx thought that material inputs went into determining what the price of goods/commodities are. ***But, instead of prices reflecting material scarcity, Marx argued that scarcity was the outcome of Capitalist's ever present need to maximize profits and influence the price of their goods***.

Maybe, instead of talking out of their ass about anticapitalist POV's OhTheUrbanity could've read a bit of Marx or Engels and seen what they thought about Capitalism. Despite the length of the video, OhTheUrbanity doesn't even mention ""Socialists/Communists believe [...]"" even once. It's like someone attempting to refute Eurocentric anthropology but never actually reading *Guns, Germs, & Steel*.

> [[05:40](https://youtu.be/tvTa-GXKxak?t=340)] Unless you fix the underlying supply imbalance, all you've done is replace high prices with waitlists, lotteries, bribery, or needing to know the right person, and some people will still be excluded.

The reason why I've formulated this post in this specific way should become more and more clear as I go on, since, this point jumps off of the point that I made in response to the last citation. Being unable to actually look into what thinkers such as Marx and Engels thought that life would be like under Socialism/Communism vs what life is currently like under Capitalism fails to give any credence to his criticisms of Left Urbanism. OhTheUrbanity fails to realize that 1: There's nothing stopping any of that from happening NOW under the Capitalist mode of urban development, unless [they think that there's nothing wrong with the proliferation of sex for rent schemes](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/29/vulnerable-uk-women-forced-into-survival-sex-by-cost-of-living-crisis) popping up all over the world in cities with high rents, and, 2: Judging the failures of non-market solutions under the Capitalist system goes back to not understanding what anti-capitalists actually want out of the World. ***Left Urbanists deny the need for the so-called ""Housing Market"" to exist at all, we favor the abolition of the Housing Market in favor of a just, equitable, and rational allocation of housing in it's place***. I will go back and expand upon this point later, but, it had to be said at this moment because it's clear that the maker of this youtube video is completely unserious about actually looking at the housing crisis from an anticapitalist POV.

> [[06:56](https://youtu.be/tvTa-GXKxak?t=416)] Not all, but, a lot of Left NIMBYism is tied up in not wanting too much change, height, or density though

If there are any Market Urbanists combing through this post assuming that I'm making my counterarguments in bad faith, I present this citation as proof-positive of what Left Urbanists have to deal with rhetorically from Market Urbanists whenever we critique Capitalism in cities.

But, to address OhTheUrbanity's point directly, assuming that they're actually making a coherent claim, this is basically an argument saying a city so intertwined with the interests of Capital like Metro Vancouver is an example of how urban development should be approached under Capitalism because it produces lots of housing/density and mixed use development near transit. Nevermind the glaring failures that have been mentioned at length about urban development strategies such as ""Vancouverism"" with it's unaffordable housing, minimal and ineffective regional governance, the cannibalization of the region's social capital, and urban sterility. Market Urbanists are only interested in fly-ver views of cities within Google Earth instead of actually spending an extended amount of time within the social fabric of the cities that they champion for policy makers to imitate.

***Left Urbanists don't want Capital accumulation to happen within cities because we firmly believe in [The Right to the City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1fiEC1MhS0), which, we see the forces of Capital in the housing market  being intrinsically opposed to.*** There's still this mistaken dogma among YIMBYs and Market Urbanists that gentrification is ""just the natural life cycle of a neighborhood"", we completely reject that and argue  instead that ***gentrification (defined as the negative Socioecopolitical changes within an area/city that may or may not cause displacement  and which changes the immediate environment to cater to upper class individuals instead of poorer citizens) is Capital's incarnation of redlining, which contradicts YIMBYs' assertion that government involvement in redlining/single family zoning is the lone historical force behind expensive real estate***. If there's any YIMBY/Market Urbanist believes me wrong in suggesting this, then, I'd challenge you to find any mainstream Urban economist who believes that the entirety of NYC's homeless population should be housed in Billionaire's Row, or, ask any of it's residents if they'd approve of Social Housing being built near their expensive condos. 

> [[7:51](https://youtu.be/tvTa-GXKxak?t=471)] [citing a online complaint about Montreal's Griffintown:] I'm not sure that I would want to further encourage the building of half million dollar closets when we can be building four story plexes with reasonable rent
>> [OhTheUrbanity:] It sounds like you want smaller buildings with larger units and cheaper rents. Almost by definition you won't be meeting demand. That's not ""abundant social housing"" for everyone, it's cheap housing for a few subject to my aesthetic and architectural preferences

Over my many aggravating days of debating Market Urbanists, I've slowly learned that if you allow for them to talk about their hatred of ""Left NIMBYs"" enough, they'll begin to contradict themselves. There's so many huge contradictions tangled within this single rebuttal that I'm at a loss for where to start my critique. Well, I guess I could point out that what the Griffintown critic is proposing is literally just cheap rents in more ""missing middle"" developments (which [OhTheUrbanity made a video praising missing middle housing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uw29fjaBRY) as the backbone of Montreal's urban character). What also confuses me is the fact that there's a massive push among YIMBYs to push politicians to allow single-stair units (totally not a huge nightmare for egress points and which unfairly disenfranchises handicapped people) because according to those same YIMBYs it'd allow more varied/larger apartment units to hit the market.

Finally, the thing that pisses me off the most about OhTheUrbanity's dismissal of the aesthetics of new housing is this mistaken idea that there's absolutely nothing wrong about the architectural style of new builds and treat any critique of new developments as frivolous. The main reason why Left Urbanists or even run of the mill citizens think all new builds are ""ugly"" is because they literally all look the same and none of them fall into the architectural context of the neighborhoods that they're built in. There's a reason why there are a bunch of tours in the greater downtown area of Detroit is entirely because of the preservation of many art-deco high rises that you rarely find in other place. This mistaken postmodernest idea that buildings have one sole function and everything else is secondary is the very same idea that is leading to the homogeneity of urbanism, which is objectively bad for our cities and contributes to the cold, uninviting Urbanist uncanny valley that gentrified neighborhoods find themselves in.

#TL;DR: A) A lot of criticism of Left Urbanism is just a manifestation of YIMBYs and Market Urbanists thinking that it's easier for them to imagine the apocalypse happening than it is for them to imagine a form of urban growth that doesn't involve markets.

# B) Left Urbanists do actually believe in the housing crisis, we just know that simple individual upzonings or allowing developers to build whatever they want wherever they want isn't going to end the crisis. 

#C) The current mode of urban development under Capitalism can't make an authentic feeling neighborhood and this robs citizens of an authentic Urbanist environment, a different approach based on socialization and spontaneity is needed to show other reagions that more can be done.

# D) Capitalism, as even a novice Left Urbanist can observe, enforces scarcity instead of allowing their commodities to be freely enjoyed by all. This means the price of units is entirely determined by Capitalist rent-seeking

#E) Gentrification is not just a ""normal function"" of urban living, it's caused by direct capital investment from players in the real estate sector and their investments will, over time, slowly change the demographics of any given area into more of a ""upper class"" setting. However, this capital investment isn't too good at creating great Urbanist neighborhoods because gentrification sterilizes the feeling of walkable cities into something colder and more alienating.

 We'll end the intro here because the rest of their video just goes over the same topics that've been addressed. So, let me explain to you all what Left Urbanists actually believe

#Part Two: Pillars Left Urbanism and the struggle for Municipal/Metropolitan Power

So, it's nice to clarify mistaken perceptions, but, what won't do Left Urbanists any good is to keep our principals a secret. Now, it's time to give a few things to the skeptics out there reading this post so we're all on the same page, what the hell is Left Urbanism anyways?

Here's some key features of our way of thinking:

1. Left Urbanists are anti-Capitalists, thus, we completely reject the idea that allowing the for-profit housing market to ""sort itself out"" or ""just build housing, lol"" it's way into affordability.

2. We see local government as not only the most important layer of government, but it's also the best possible route towards the creation of a freer, fairer, most humane mode of urban living/urban development. Thus proposals such as putting all land under public ownership, abolishing rent, allowing all classes of citizens to afford to move wherever they wish, etc. are all valid goals to strive for and would make for a vastly different social order in our cities.

3. The closest vision that most Left Urbanist thinkers have a blueprint to a radically revolutionary experience is the short-lived Paris Commune. However, we understand that any struggle to establish a Radical anti-Capitalist government must learn from the mistakes of both dead Leftist governments and the dystopian existence of actually existing ""Left"" governments such as China.

Left Urbanism is so much more than being a ""PHIMBY"", we see Capital's grip on urban life as a process of slow strangulation, of activity, of diversity, of social class, etc. until there's nothing left but a sterile, negatively photogenic landscape of faux brick, steel and asphalt with little to no contact between people. 

#TL;DR TWO: Left Urbanists are by definition anti-Capitalists, pro Municipalism/Direct Democracy, and mindful of the Left's political failures in the past.

---

#Part Three: ""What about Market Socialism? Georgism? Social Democracy even?""

* Market Socialism might be an attractive prospect to certain people within the Urbanist community,  even among Libertarian minded Market Urbanists. However, any Municipal project that relied on the whims of the ""business community"" would be to fraught with factional tensions, since, Capitalists would still find ways to extract rents and influence public policy in their favor in a unchallenged post-Citizen's United world, Market Socialism would mean the death of individual agency among the public.

* Georgism is very popular among policy wonks,  Libertarian Urbanists, and reform minded Neoliberals. They market it as ""the best way to tax wealth"" since, they argue, land isn't infitite. But, to see the glaring blindspot in Georgism, one has to look no further than analyzing the population/business trends in Metro Detroit from ~1920 to 2025. The inner city was too cramped to handle additional auto plants, so, the plants moved to the suburbs, and kicked off decade of capital flight and brain drain. There's nothing stopping the Capitalists from either fleeing a city with a LYT, or, raising prices to eat away at the dividend given to citizens by the LVT.

* Last of all, we come to Social Democracy, or, what remains of it since all of the Center-Left parties around the world have either been forced out of power by reactionaries, or, those same Center-Left parties adopted far-right policy to keep those same reactionaries out of power. I'd recommend both YIMBYs and PHIMBYs to pick up a copy of a book called ""Technofeudalism"" by former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, in the book, he spells out the reasons why the domination of firms like Google and Amazon have killed the prospect of Social Democracy from emerging again. I won't spoil it, but it's a must-read if you want to understand the power that  the corporate world has over our elected government.

#TL:DR THREE: All potential alternatives to Left popular politics have no comprehensive vision for what cities should look like in the post-pandemic economic world. Since Market Socialism will be eventually overthrown by Capitalists, Georgism can simply be avoided via capital flight and Social Democracy is ill equipped to take on the massive manpower of a firm like Walmart or Amazon, the only logical step forward is for Left Urbanists is to show the public what a strong, radically democratic municipal/Metropolitan Government can do.

first of all apologies for a previous half baked post i had made.

I would like to move to Netherlands in the future, not a PR but i would like to spend like 4-5 years there. I have heard a lot about the cycles there, walkable culture and A lot of NotJustBikes videos on netherlands - plus it seems probably multicultural enough to not look out like a sore thumb(might be wrong)

my qualifications: cs bachelor's, 3 years at Google(from India) as an L4

1. How is the job market like in Amsterdam/netherlands right now? in tech? should I expect any callbacks if i start applying to roles there online? (google doesn't have any offices or is hiring for that location)
2. how is the anti immigrant sentiment there right now? Bad or mostly ok with some racism?
3. has anyone does this recently, in the last 2-3 years? if so, what was your timeline like?
4. I'm also considering a masters in TU Delft, but if the job market isn't great - I will not be leaving my job for a master's. 

Thanks

Netherlands,"Bought a e-bike ( fat tires) 3 years ago in a shop in Amsterdam , realizing now it’s illegal in  Netherlands.","Hi all! 

About 3 years ago I bought a fat-tire e-bike from a shop here in the Netherlands. I wasn’t aware back then that it had a throttle (so I can ride without pedaling) or that it could go above 35 km/h. I’ve been riding it responsibly, but only recently I found out that both of these things make it illegal as a normal e-bike here.

It feels a bit unfair as I spent nearly €2000 on it, bought it from a legit shop,located in Amsterdam - but now everytime I ride it ( I commute daily with it to work ) I feel a bit scared that the police is gonna stop me and fine me.

So now I’m wondering:
	•	Do people actually get stopped/fined for this?
	•	Can I get the bike modified so it complies with the 25 km/h pedal-assist-only rules?
	•	Or do I have to somehow register it as a moped/scooter to be safe? ( if this option is a thing, then I would prefer doing so) 

Has anyone else run into this situation? Would love to hear what you did.

Thanks for the help everyone.

Netherlands,Bike itinerary in Netherlands,"So I'm an American planning a trip to the Netherlands at the end of September and I want to run some questions by you all. I'll mostly be hanging out in Amsterdam and visiting a buddy in Groningen for a couple of days, but then I have 3.5 days to do my own thing. 

In that time I'm planning to rent a bike and cycle from Amsterdam to Leiden, Den Haag, Delft, and maybe Rotterdam. I'm a novice cyclist and I probably do about 50km a week on average. Then I would probably take the train back to Amsterdam before flying home. 

First question: is this a good itinerary? Is there a better bike trip under like 100km total? I would like to see scenic things if possible. I am aware of the knooppunten routes but haven't done any detailed planning. 

Second question: what should I do with my luggage? I'll basically have one heavy backpack and a small sling bag. I'm not used to cycling with a backpack on my back, but I could train at home with one to prepare if necessary. Are there rental lockers at train stations to leave luggage in, like in Japan for example?

Third: what do I do if I have a flat or mechanical issue somewhere on the route between cities? 

Last: are there bike rentals that allow multi-day trips, rent out good locks, and possibly allow you to return a bike in a different city than you started in? 

I spent six months studying in Amsterdam a long time ago so I'm excited to go back. Now I want to see things I didn't see the first time I was there.

Netherlands,Buying an ebike or private leasing options in Amsterdam?,"Hi all,

I live in the Netherlands and I'm looking to buy an e-bike.

Ideally my budget is 1.5k, but I'm trying to understand if I can get something decent with such price or if a private lease - if available - would be a better option.

I was thinking to get the RockRider from decathlon, [https://www.decathlon.nl/p/elektrische-hybridefiets-e-actv-100-laag-frame/\_/R-p-356245](https://www.decathlon.nl/p/elektrische-hybridefiets-e-actv-100-laag-frame/_/R-p-356245) however I am concerned that the battery capacity (356 Wh) is too low.

I live approx 6km from the city center and use the bike min 3/4 times a week back and forth to do 12 to 20 km, if not more on weekends. I would not want to face the situation where I'm far and out of battery....

Another option would be to lease but I couldn't find a provider (apart from Swapfiets) that offers private lease (not through your employer) in the Netherlands.

Finally, one last question: what is the average lifespan of a ebike? I am also considering raising my budget, but if in 2-3 years I will have to do expensive repairs or change model, then just leasing a swapfiets is easier.

What do you think?

Netherlands,Unpopular Opinion: the bakfiets hype is ridiculous,"Every day, my city (in the Randstad, not Amsterdam) looks a little more like a luxury bakfiets outlet. Urban Arrows and other shiny €5000 bakfietsen everywhere with absolutely nothing in them. Sometimes there’s a 10-year-old lounging inside instead of just riding their own bike. But most of the time, it is just empty air. And when the bakfietsen aren't on the bike paths, they’re parked on the sidewalks, completely blocking the space of four normal bikes.

Let me be clear, before anyone calls me jealous or ignorant: I have a toddler. I have no car and bike everywhere (on my lame-ass non-electric omafiets, where I have to pedal for myself and my toddler on the backseat). I’ve rented bakfietsen to get furniture bought on Marktplaats, and they’re great when you need them!

I just don't get why every average Dutch or expat family suddenly needs their own personal electric cargo tank, even if their children are at an age where they are fully capable of cycling themselves, live 15 minutes from literally everything, and their heaviest purchases is Vla from Albert Heijn, delivered to their doorstep.

Why don't people rent one when they need it? Why do they buy the fanciest and most expensive models, of course all electrically driven? Why don't they - god forbid - let their 10 year-old cycle by themselves?Honestly, I am convinced that the bakfiets is a mobile status symbol of eco-chiqueness and the bicycle equivalent of an SUV.

So, people of the bakfiets country, help me understand. What are we exactly aiming to achieve when cycling the streets with empty but fancy electric cargo bikes ?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Netherlands/comments/1mkurir/unpopular_opinion_the_bakfiets_hype_is_ridiculous/,1754658536.0,44,Amsterdam cycling,search,2025-08-08 13:08:56

travel,France - Switzerland - Netherlands - Belgium Itinerary Review,"Hi everyone,

My boyfriend and I fly into Paris on August 28th and leaving Sept 14. We want to explore France and a couple of neighbouring countries. It's both our first time travelling here so looking for feedback on what we have planned so far.

When travelling, our interests are around food, general sight-seeing/touristy stuff, nature, and try to find some unique experiences and delve into the countries culture.

I haven't planned what we're doing each day yet, just trying to finalize what cities we will be visiting and for how long. We want to get in a good hike (that we can do in less than 8 hours), hence why we thought we'd base ourselves in Geneva for a few days and do a day trip to Chamonix or Bonneville - but would love to hear other hiking spots that may be less out of the way. 

So far we have...

**August 28 - Sept 2 - Paris**  

* Activities: Walking tour when we arrive, Eiffel Tower, Louvre, Notre Dame Cathedral, and exploring Montmartre and Le Marais, Seine River cruise, day trip to Palace of Versailles

**Sept 2-4 - Lyon**  

* Travel: Train from Paris to Lyon   
* Activities:  Explore around the old port; Fourviere hillside, roman sights/museum; Day trip to Vienne
* Food: Any restaurant recommendations??

**Sept 4-7 - Geneva** 

* Travel: Train from Lyon to Geneva 
* Activities: Day trip to Chamonix or Bonneville for a hike; Lake Geneva, the Jet d'Eau, and the Old Town; maybe a day trip to Annecy?

**Sept 7-10 - Amsterdam** 

* Travel: Thinking to save time we will from from Geneva to Amsterdam
* Activities: Walking tour, Canal boat tour, Jordaan District Walk, visit Anne Frank House, Foodhallen for food, De 9 Straatjes, Rijksmuseum, hoping to rent bikes for a bike ride if it seems doable, Albert Cuyp Market, Houseboat Museum

**Sept 10-12 - Ghent**

* Travel: Train from Amsterdam to Ghent 
* Activities: Walking tour, Gravensteen Castle, St. Bavo’s Cathedral, Lys River, Patershol District, Korenmarkt & Sint-Michielshelling

  
**Sept 12-14 - Brussels** 

* Travel: Train from Ghent to Brussels 
* Activities: Walking tour, Grand Place, Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert, Royal Palace & Parc de Bruxelles, Saint-Géry, Saint-Géry

  
**Sept 14 morning - train back to Paris** 

Questions:

When buying train tickets we usually buy them in advance, but heard it's cheaper to buy them at the station. Is this true? We're worried the times we want will be sold out when we arrive. Any insight is appreciated!

Is Geneva worth the stop? Would it be best to stay in Annecy instead or another destination we should consider? Trying to optimize our itinerary to minimize back-and-forth. 

Any feedback is appreciated!

Thanks so much.

Netherlands,I JUST GOT HERE,"Im 28 and Im a Polish guy. After spending 15 years in the UK, I decided it was no longer fun. I visited Amsterdam once for a city break about four years ago, and I loved it — the stunning sights, the canals, the buildings, and the magical atmosphere. (The weed? Not so much...) Anyways, I recently decided that the UK doesn’t have much to offer anymore; it’s too racist and too different from most of Europe.
 
I was a kid when I left Poland, and it may seem strange, but I was really scared to go back because, after all these years in the UK, I simply prefer to communicate in English. I hope I ve made the right choice, as I know language isn’t a problem in Nederland.
 
So, I have a few questions. Is it really okay to start speaking English right away, or do people in Nederland dislike that? Should I ask if it’s okay to speak English long term, or is it generally fine? What do people in Nederland think about foreigners in general, and Poles in particular? Whats it like to live there? Are there things I should know? For example, should I always give way to bikes, or do pedestrians have priority? Is it considered rude to eat or use a mobile phone on public transport? Should I avoid walking alone after dark?
 
I would love to hear your thoughts on the differences, things to watch out for, things to avoid or do basically, the general flow of life there. Tell me anything; I want to learn about the country and soak it all in.

Netherlands,E-scooter use allowed in the Netherlands since July,"Just discovered that

>**E-scooter use allowed in the Netherlands since July**

>Since July 1, 2025, it has been legal to use an e-scooter on the streets of the Netherlands. The electric scooter now falls into the category of special mopeds, allowing anyone over the age of 16 to ride the scooters on Dutch cycle paths, provided they have an official blue licence plate and do not go faster than 25 kilometres per hour. Drivers of e-scooters are also not required to wear helmets.

>There has been growing concern as an increasing number of faster vehicles are allowed on bike paths, creating dangerous situations. Dutch municipalities are even set to experiment with speed limits on cycle paths to combat this issue. The addition of e-scooters on the roads has the potential to exacerbate the situation.

Amsterdam,"Beautiful city, but the public cannabis use is hard to ignore as a tourist","Hey Amsterdam folks and fellow travelers,

Just finished my first full week in Amsterdam and wanted to say: what an incredible city. The canals, the bikes, the architecture, the culture… it's all been amazing. Thanks for the hospitality!

That said, I wanted to share one thing that really stood out (and not in a good way): the frequent smell and use of cannabis in very public places. I'm not talking about the Red Light District at night (which is kind of expected), but early mornings outside places like the opera house, near restaurants, shops, or even hotel entrances. It caught me off guard and honestly made certain experiences less enjoyable.

I completely respect that Amsterdam has a different attitude toward cannabis than many places, and I'm not trying to tell locals how to live, but for a tourist trying to enjoy a morning walk or a quiet coffee by the canals, it can feel overwhelming at times.

Amsterdam,35 sqm apartment at Buitenveldert Amsterdam VS 60 sqm apartment at Diemen Centre,"I'm currently trying to buy an apartment on my own (budget: 330k max) and have been looking at properties near Gelderlandplein, Amsterdam Zuid. Most of the apartments I can afford are around 320k with 35 square meters, all built in 1960s, with energy label B-D . The location is excellent — it has two large parks and one smaller park nearby, plus easy access to the Gelderlandplein shopping mall, Zuidas, VU, Oud Zuid and Amstelveen as well. All of these are within walking or cycling distance, and even De Pijp or further areas are reachable by bike in under 25 minutes.I’ve lived here for 3 years and I really like the neighborhood — it's peaceful (but not too quiet), green, safe, convenient, and has a diverse, multinational community.

The concern I have at the moment is that the apartments I can afford here are quite small. A 35 sqm apartment would likely require me to move again in the future if my living needs change (unless I have a very strict space management). And if I need to upgrade during a market downturn, I might have no choice but to sell the smaller apartment at a loss. On the other hand, if I were to buy a slightly larger apartment — say, 55 to 60 sqm at a less central area, I might not feel the need to move for quite a while. That would reduce the risk of being forced to sell at a bad time.

Therefore, I’ve also started looking at apartments in Diemen.

From what I’ve seen, quite a few 59–60 sqm apartments with asking price 325k have been listed on Funda in the past year, especially around Tobias Asserlaan street and the surrounding area. The location seems nice — it's close to the Diemenplein shopping mall and Diemen Station. The commute to Amsterdam Zuid, De Pijp, or the 9 Straatjes takes about 35–40 minutes, which is roughly 10–15 minutes longer than from Buitenveldert, Amsterdam. So I keep asking myself: is it worth spending a little more time commuting in exchange for a more spacious apartment in a less central neighborhood?

I expect to live alone for several more years, and having a very very safe neighborhood is a top priority for me. Diemen seems nice, but it has more of a family-oriented vibe. The local facilities aren't as well-developed as those near Gelderlandplein, and it’s slightly less convenient when it comes to accessing the rest of Amsterdam.

At the same time, the value retention is my second biggest concern when buying property. I don’t expect a huge return on my apartment, but I do want to minimize the risk of financial loss, especially if the economy takes a downturn — which I believe is quite possible in the next few years :(

All of this has been a bit overwhelming, so I’d really appreciate any insights or thoughts you might have. Thank you! 😊

Is cash withdrawal a problem there?

Can I pay with debit card or with Apple Pay? Asking I faced this problem in Cancun - my card didn’t work almost anywhere and I couldn’t neither pay nor withdraw the money.

How is WiFi and mobile service there? 

I have read somewhere that a couple booked a hotel called Paradise something, they arrived to Ouvea and it turned out the hotel was closed.

How are the flights? Are delays or cancellations common?

now, despite me being in NL for years, I have never visited Efteling or the area, so I can't recommend much to them. I have searched this sub, and read past questions about what to do in the area, but many answers just ask them to visit places far away (Amsterdam, Rotterdam and such). My friends have already been in NL before and this time it's just holidays with the kids, focused on things to do with the small ones. They are not much into visiting cities (let's face it...5YO kids have not much patience for seeing buildings and such xD).  
I told them to visit (maybe a couple days) the Biesbosch national park, as it's reachable by bikes., but apart from that I have not much idea what they can see in the south.

Any recommendation? Anyone who did anything similar and would like to add a place to visit/something to do?

I also looked for electric bikes to rent, with some sort of box in the front to put the kids/backpacks, but I could find nothing :(

Just got to Amsterdam for exchange and moved into Social Hub West. First time living here. Google says the area’s “up-and-coming” or “diverse” or whatever, but what’s the actual deal?

	•	Is the area chill or do I need to keep my eyes open at night?
	•	What kinda people live around here — mostly students, families, expats?
	•	Any lowkey bars, cafés or parks I should know about?
	•	How’s biking around here? Any sketchy spots to avoid?
	•	And on a random note, what’s the vibe with politics/media here? Like, what do people read/watch that’s not total BS?

Amsterdam,Cycle safety - kids,"What can be done about cycle safety in Amsterdam? 

I ask since this morning I was cycling with my kids to primary school. I was 2-abreast with my smaller kid, when a cyclist overtook,  cut in, and clipped my front wheel and nearly sending me tumbling. I cycled up to him and asked what happened. His aggressive response was that I was at fault for taking up too much space and he did it deliberately. This from a grey haired man in his late 50's on a city bike. 

I'm used to children going 30 or 40 on bike paths on fatbikes,, I'm used to mopeds doing 40 or 50 through the Westerpark, I'm used to motorbikes taking to bike lanes when traffic is queuing on the road, but this really shook me up - the language he used was not part of the inburgeren exam I took - he deliberately caused a collision then got aggressive when I called him out on it.

I read this report (below) which says that less children are cycling to school and it chimes with my reality - it would be safer for me to drive them to school than to run the gauntlet of unsafe bike paths. 

It seems that in banning mopeds from bike lanes the risks have got worse not better. At least a moped  was accountable (number plate), insured, and had an APK with a rider had received instruction and was of a certain age. Fatbike riders have none of these things and seem to have create a dog-eat-dog environment where aggressive me-first riding has been normalised. 

  
I don't want to turn this into a rant - rather ask whether anything can be done? By the Gemeente for example? They put signs up in the Westerpark urging people to cycle safely, but TBH I can't see a simple sign changing the behaviour of someone who's decided to ride a motorbike through the park at 50kmh. On the one occasion (in 15 years of living in Amsterdam) that I saw a police officer try to stop a motorbike in a cycle lane, the rider turned tail and rode off. I asked the officer why he wasn't pursuing him - response - ""we're trained not to"".

I don't want to start driving my kids to school but am at a point when I think it's the only safe way to get them about. Ideas anyone?

Netherlands,Transportation for visitors?,"Hello, 

My family is going to visit me here in June. I myself I'm here just 4 months. We would like to go to Amsterdam by train one day (and back from Tilburg) and also travel by bikes somewhere. The dilemma is that one company rents bikes for 10€ a day. But if I manage to get a personal ov-chipkaart with NS Flex subscription that costs 5€/month, I can get them 2 bikes for just around 5€/day. And I could use 40% discount for a train with them but they would need to pay 7.50€ each for anonymous ov-card where they need to activate the discount at the machine. I don't know if it's all worth the effort for just 4 to 5 days.

I have few additional questions:

1) Is it possible that they just activate the discount, don't top up their anonymous cards, and I will pay it in my subscription for them? How do I need to check in? There's an app NS Flex. Do I need to scan some QR code three times there when going on a train? Do I need to activate the discount too? Do they need to check in too with their anonymous cards? Do I need to check out when going off the train?
2) Is this 40% discount applicable just when I check in physically or even when buying tickets online (in app)?
3) Does the '3 additional passangeres' thing apply just during the off-peak hours in week days or even at weekends? The site also doesn't clarify if the weekend offer is 24 hours a day or just off-peak hours.
4) Is the 40% discount applicable on trains or all public transport?

Netherlands,Help (Re)-Learning to Ride a Bike,"Hello!

Also posted in r/Amsterdam but posting here in case someone has some other insights. 

I arrived in Amsterdam earlier this week and turns out the saying “just like riding a bike” doesn’t apply to me. Perhaps I didn’t learn all the fundamentals when I was young but it felt like I’d never been on a bike before and cycling back home on the Swapfiets I overconfidently rented was harrowing to say the least.

I’ve gone through old posts here where people have asked the same question and I’ve gotten some great tips I’ll be implementing – working on balance, practicing in a park etc.

What I’m really after though is a teacher. I know myself and I learn far better if I can ask questions and there’s someone I can talk to. I’ve contacted Jimmy from Koala Bike Lessons and he only has availability in June and so far, community centers have lessons at times that don’t work for someone with a job. Does anyone know another private teacher or would be willing to give me some lessons that could start asap? I really feel I’d be missing out lots if I don’t learn to cycle.

I’m based in Westerpark, super close to the park.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Netherlands/comments/1jvrbmi/help_relearning_to_ride_a_bike/,1744266455.0,3,Amsterdam cycling,search,2025-04-10 06:27:35

Hello everyone! I have an important question and I am hoping you share your generous opinion as it really matters. 

I have a social housing in Almere stad  (muziekwijk) but my workplace is in Amsterdam and I commute with public transport for +1 hour one-way daily. 

I tried my best to find a swap with another social with no luck, so decided to look for free sector/middelhuur and I found a relatively good one in a really nice area closer to my workplace and my community. 

My question is I’m gonna pay X1.5 my current rent at least. Is it a good idea or I’m actually doing something stupid leaving a cheaper rent. 

(Bear in mind that the new flat in Amsterdam  is completely empty and old, I kind of have to pay for a full renovation including bathroom and kitchen and the house I have in Almere is built this year) 

Please let me know your thoughts/opinion/experience asap I have to respond in a couple of days 
Many many thnx 🙏


Update: the house is full of asbestos, not sure even they will give me permission to renovate anything. 

All in all, I don’t see it’s the correct flat for me after all.

travel,Netherland Tulips by Keukenhof Gardens,"Hi, I'm coming to the tulips around Keukenhof Gardens, Lisse, Netherlands (I'm so excited). I'm planning on taking bus 361 from Schiphol to Noordwijk, Boerenburg stop on van de Mortelstraat. I'm staying at NH Noordwijk Conference Centre Leeuwenhorst. It's a 30 min walk. I'd rather take an Uber. I will have just landed from the states and be exhausted. How abundant are Ubers? Any suggestions are welcomed. Thanks. Keep in mind, I will be brain dead from the flight. The easiest is the best. Appreciated!

Hello post trip. I had a wonderful time in the Netherlands. The public transit is very easy to navigate. I downloaded the transit app & had it ready to go before travel. I rented a bicycle and a car. The roads were easy to navigate and cycling is very safe with clearly marked lanes for cyclists. Amsterdam is wonderful and easy to navigate. I went out early (6-6:30 am) for pristine pictures without tourists in the streets or in the canals. I highly recommend renting a bicycle and seeing the tulip fields rather than going to Keukenhof Gardens. As recommended, I arrived at the gardens early (9am). My bicycle and maybe 4 0r 5 others were it in the parking area on the opposite side of the main entrance. When I left at 11 am, becasue the crowds were beyond bearable (and rude) the bicyle area  was full. There are many online sites with clear maps of the fields. There are numbermarker signs on the roads directing to the coordinating fields on the map. The ocean and beach are close by and the dunes are worth the visit. Thank you for your help. I wasn't brain dead from jet lag as I started waking up early and functioning on your time weeks before the trip.

travel,19 y/o female travel,"First- I’m just an older Mom. My last child, and my only daughter is a freshman in college and wants to take another trip this year. You are all extremely knowledgeable and I’m feeling clueless because she’s aged out of the youth adventure trips she’s taken in the past. At 15 she went for two weeks and hiked Yellowstone and the Tetons and two years ago she went to Amsterdam, Germany, Switzerland and Venice for two weeks.  I’ve always just booked her with one of the Youth adventure trips and I didn’t have to worry too much.  Sent my boys on month long trips the same way when they were in high school. 

I’ve checked out Contiki, terrible reviews, Intrepid is the same and now looking at G Adventures.   Im hoping to keep the trip around 5-6k.  She would love to go to Greece and island hop- but is open to anywhere, just wants to travel.   She fell in love with Switzerland. 

She’s a good girl, parties a little but knows her limits, getting straight As in College so far and belongs to a sorority. She also just broke up with her bf of a year and half.  She gets along with all age ranges, and tends to be a leader in group settings.  Daughter and her travel friends got lost biking in Switzerland and she got them back where they needed to be.  

My concern with some of the companies are age ranges, her safety, and knowing I’m sending her off alone and she will be in a group setting that knows where she is at least most of the time.  LOL. I don’t think I’m capable of planning her whole trip alone.  

Should I call a travel agent?  
Book a trip with G Adventures with a wish and a prayer? 
Or does anyone know of another company that fits her age a little better? 
Or should I not worry about age ranges to much? I know she wouldn’t be too excited about traveling with a bunch of grandmas.

Netherlands,"Feeling violated by police bicycle raid at Sloterdijk, Amsterdam","Today around 17.00 there was a police raid at Sloterdijk station in Amsterdam. Quite an entourage of around 10 police vans and cars. It felt so intimidating, I thought there was a murder or something. But then I saw an electric bicycle speed tester. Ok, cool, cracking down on the fast e-bikes.

What got me though was that when I walked out of the station I got on the bicycle and got stopped after 2m for ""biking in the station area"" where the Sloterdijk bike parking literally exits onto the street. Not sure if it is considered the area, but there are no signs prohibiting bicycles and it's not inside the station. Said the same thing to the officer, but she just didn't budge. Didn't want to argue much after a tiring day at work and just gave my ID for the fine. Saw many other people get stopped for the same thing too. Later leaving I even saw 2 officers standing at one junction there and catching people for not showing hand signals where quite a tight turn is. How petty can they be?

It just seems unfair to set this kind of raid at 17.00 when every working person is coming home from work. I went there 40 minutes later and they had already left. :D It's like you just got off the train after a hard day at work- here's a ticket.

On my fourth attempt, I finally passed the driving exam. I’m writing this to give some insight to those planning to get a license in the Netherlands—and to let out my frustration, of course. It's going to be a long one because I’ll try to cover everything I remember. Here goes.

Let’s start with the theory part. Just like in Turkey, before you can take the practical test, you need to pass the theory exam. Once you pass the theory exam, you get 1.5 years to pass the practical exam. If you don’t do it within that time, you’ll need to redo the theory test to take the practical one.

From what I understand, most of the theoretical rules here are similar to Turkey’s, probably because Turkey has adjusted its regulations to align with EU standards. For instance, traffic signs mostly mean the same thing. Some driving schools offer classes specifically to prepare you for the theory exam. I skipped those and instead studied on [thiswebsite](https://www.theorieexamen.nl/theorie-examens?ref=gad&keyword=theorie%20examen&ref=gad&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADMHqI37o3qnKz_qpJUWeaAxyurYH&gclid=Cj0KCQiAoae5BhCNARIsADVLzZeoAlIxTOca_kXVKoSNykRevvozi8G6WPT80bWDAG-I7WaZJd0zOOAaAiZXEALw_wcB). A one-week membership costs around €14, and I totally recommend it because the exercises and lessons there are great.

In the theory exam, they start by asking about road signs and their meanings. After that, there are questions about the car itself. Then they show you real-life scenarios and give you about 5 (?) seconds to respond with what you would do in that situation. Here, it’s especially crucial to know who has priority in different scenarios—for example, giving way to someone coming from the right, or if someone coming from across you is turning left while you’re going straight, you have the right of way. By studying the materials on that website, I passed on my first attempt; honestly, it wasn’t too hard. At the end of the exam, you immediately find out if you passed or not. My advice is to pass the theory test first before starting any practical lessons. Some schools might not even let you start until you’ve passed the theory.

Now for the practical part. Friends, driving in the Netherlands—at least to the standard needed to pass the test—is a whole other story compared to Turkey. One of the main reasons is that the road design here is completely different; it feels like they’ve set it up like a computer game. Random obstacles, lanes that narrow and widen for no reason, weird roundabouts—it’s wild. You really need a lot of practice to get used to the Dutch road infrastructure.

The second issue is the bikes. You especially have to be careful with them when you’re leaving roundabouts or turning off main roads, because they can appear from literally anywhere. It’s important in the test but also a real threat once you’re actually on the road here.

Let’s talk about choosing a driving school (rijschool) first. Especially if you live in the Randstad area and are new to the country, there’s a major scam these schools will pull on you. Here’s how it goes: they offer as many lessons as you want—15 hours, 20 hours, whatever—and during the lessons, they don’t actually teach you much, just intervene in critical moments. Then they send you to the exam unprepared, you fail, of course, and then get back on Reddit to rant. Then you get ready again with the same school, and before you know it, you’ve failed for the second time.

So, what should be the most important criterion when picking a school? It’s definitely the pass rate of its students. I recommend checking this on CBR’s [website](https://www.cbr.nl/nl/vergelijk-rijscholen-met-de-cbr-rijschoolzoeker) and avoiding schools with a pass rate below 60%. Yes, these schools technically give you lessons, but the real money is in their students constantly failing and taking more lessons. Talk about a system! I failed my first three tests with the same school and worked with a different one for the fourth attempt; DM me if you want the name of the new one!

So, we’ve passed the theory test and found a reliable school with a pass rate above 60%. What’s next? I met so many people who have been driving for years in Turkey but still had to retake the test here, sometimes even a second or third time. So, this isn’t about being a “pro” driver; it’s about understanding the Dutch infrastructure and following their road rules, plus doing things that will impress the examiner during the test.

The first thing you’ll learn, and probably find ridiculously excessive—like every non-Dutch person does—is that every time you change lanes, turn right or left, or even pull over to the side, you must always, always, always first check your rearview mirror, then the side mirrors, and finally, check your blind spot by looking over your shoulder. Only after that can you signal. Don’t even think of saying, “Why bother?” or “Aren’t the mirrors enough?” or “The road’s empty anyway.” Every time: rearview, side, shoulder. No exceptions.

Okay, now that we’ve got the looking part down, let’s talk about speed limits. If you go over the speed limit, you fail. Simple enough, right? But what’s truly wild here is that on about 80% of the roads, the speed limit isn’t actually posted anywhere! You’re just supposed to know. How? That’s where those 20-30 hours of lessons come in handy. After enough practice, you start picking up on the road design and can guess the speed limit based on that. Once you can recognize the difference between a 30, 50, 60, and 80 km/h road just by looking, you’re getting somewhere.

Another thing about speed limits: just as you’ll fail if you go over the limit, you’ll also fail if you’re too far under it! I know, it sounds insane. Like, here I am driving 45 in a 50 zone because I feel safer that way, and they’re like, “Nope.” Speed limits here aren’t like Turkey, where you just need to stay below the limit—here, they want you to actually go the exact speed, as long as conditions allow. If it’s a 50 zone and the road is clear, you need to be going 50. No going 30 in a 50, or 20 in a 30 zone. I’m dead serious—people fail because they drive just 5 km/h below the limit. During my last test, the examiner even reminded me to go exactly at the speed limit.

So, what’s the goal during all these lessons? I’d say 50% is genuinely learning to drive safely on your own, and the other 50% is about impressing the examiner. They want to see that you can drive (these two words are critical, by the way, they might even ask you these exact terms before the test—they did for me) “safely” and “on your own.” So you basically have to become a bit of a show-off when you’re driving. At every junction, every traffic light, every time you have the right of way, you need to keep looking all around—left, right, back, forward—and more importantly, make it super obvious that you’re looking. This part is essential.

So we’ve got the looking-around habit down, we understand speed limits, we’re neither over nor under, so far so good. Next up is pedestrian crossings. If there’s anything that makes Europe *Europe*, besides the wealth from colonial times, it’s that cars stop for pedestrians. If you ignore a pedestrian and try to drive on like you’re in Turkey, the examiner will slam the brakes so hard your head will spin, and then you’ll be back at the CBR in tears. Here, it’s not just about stopping if there’s a pedestrian crossing; you’re also expected to slow down if you see someone approaching a crossing. Yep, Holland also teaches you to read minds.

Then we have roundabouts, one of the great Dutch miracles. Honestly, roundabouts here are what this concept is supposed to look like, as opposed to the ones in Turkey that still have traffic lights. Here, it’s simple: you give way to whoever’s already in the roundabout, and if it’s clear, you go in. Basic rules: if you’re taking the third exit (going left), you enter the roundabout with your left blinker on; if it’s the first exit (going right), right blinker; going straight? No blinker. And as you leave, you signal right. And an extra bit of caution here: if there are bikes on the outside of the roundabout, you must yield to them as you exit. So yes, as you leave the roundabout, you go full monkey mode, looking right, left, ahead, and behind to make sure there’s no bike in sight.

Another important thing: yielding to cars on your right. Here’s the tricky part: you could be driving at 60, see a road on your right at the last minute, and bam—you didn’t slow down in time and just failed. Luckily, in the city at 30 km/h, this is easier to manage. You see a road on the right, slow down to about 10-15 km/h, look carefully, and if no car or bike is coming, you go. This rule is the single most important part of Dutch driving culture. You need to be super attentive to it.

Then there’s the highway. My God, this part makes my blood boil every time I think about it. So, you’re on the ramp to merge, going around 85-90, and you see a truck coming up very slowly in the left lane, so you can merge safely. You check your rearview, side mirrors, shoulder, put on your signal, and start merging slowly—then suddenly, BAM! The examiner slams the gas, and you’re glued to the seat. Why? Because, as we’ve discussed, you must be driving at the speed limit. If conditions allow, you’re expected to enter the highway at 100. No excuses.

And one more highway rule: you can’t stay in the left lane unless you’re passing someone. This one’s actually great; you never see people just chilling at 80 in the left lane. But here’s the strange part: you also can’t chill in the right lane if you’re doing 80 either! At least for the exam. Say you merge onto the highway, you’re in the right lane, but there’s a truck ahead doing 80. Your exit is coming up soon, and the right lane is crowded, so passing and getting back over could be tough. But hey, doesn’t matter—our goal is to go the speed limit. So you switch to the left lane, get up to 100, and stay there until you’re about 600 meters from your exit. And also, put on your right blinker at around 300 meters to the exit.

Speaking of which, in the city, you also have to stay in the right lane whenever possible. So if you’re on a two-lane road, you should always be in the right lane unless there’s a slow vehicle in front of you. Also, if you’re in the right lane at a light and there’s a truck ahead, it’s okay to switch to the left lane.

Lastly, let’s talk about “bijzondere verrichtingen,” or special maneuvers. There are a few of these: reversing, reverse parking, forward parking, parallel parking, hill starts, U-turns, and three-point turns. During the test, they’ll ask you to perform two of these. I won’t go into all of them, but you can check them out in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9STm8-fASM).

Here’s something interesting: there isn’t a designated parking area for these. They might take you to a random street and say, “Find an appropriate spot on this street to parallel park.” My advice? Don’t just park in the first empty space—take your time, go down the street, and find a spot that really works. Also, they don’t expect you to park perfectly on your first try. Let’s say you’re reversing and see it’s not going to fit; just go forward a bit and try again. The main thing is not that you nail it right away but that you perform the maneuver in a “safe” way.

So, U-turns, parking—all good, but remember, the whole time you need to act like a monkey, constantly looking left, right, forward, and back. Every time you check your mirrors or look over your shoulder, you’re essentially showing the examiner that you are keeping it all safe. Make it clear you’re aware of your surroundings the entire time.

Let’s talk about the test itself. First of all, getting a test appointment takes at least three months, so the earliest date you’ll find will be three months from now. That means you’ll have three months to keep practicing with lessons. And if you fail, well, that’s another three-month wait, unfortunately. Here’s another wild bit: if you fail four times, the fifth test is longer and more relaxed, taking about 1.5 hours instead of 35 minutes, and they even give you a break halfway through. Thankfully, I didn’t need it, but good to know, right?

You can book the test date yourself, but I suggest having your school handle it. The fee is around €300. Lessons also cost around €60-70 per hour, so it’s definitely not cheap. Anyway, let’s say the day of the test arrives. The exams start at your local CBR testing center. You’ll take the test in your school’s car.

The exam lasts around 35 minutes. First, they’ll take you through regular city streets. They might say “turn right” or “turn left,” and if they don’t give you any instructions, just keep driving straight. They’ll probably squeeze in the special maneuvers within the first 10-15 minutes. After that, they’ll take you onto the highway and check if you’re following the rules we talked about earlier. Then, they’ll put on the navigation and ask you to follow it back to the CBR center. You park the car, get out with your hands probably shaking, go back inside the CBR building, sit down, and find out whether you passed or not—and if not, exactly why you failed. Then you go to Reddit and share your experience with everyone.

Netherlands,Overreacting to a POC kid: racism or is it normal to yell at a kid biking? ,"I was biking in Rotterdam today, near Blijdorp, where there's a wide bike path, meaning people bike on both sides of the road. All of a sudden I saw a tall blond guy who quickly changed his lane and biked towards me, because there was a kid in front of him and he had to take over the boy. The kid was somewhere between 6 to 8, he was black and biking slowly, and maybe a bit diagonally (zigzag), but not much that I noticed it. The tall guy who took over him, turned around and pointed to him with his arm in a way to teach him a lesson and made angry expressions. I don't think I heard him saying something but it was rather growling angrily. I mean he could just took over the kid without all these gestures, what was that about?

My question is if the kid on the bike was a white blond kid, do you think he would have reacted in the same? 

Is it racism, latent racism, or is it normal to react to kids biking not so perfect in such an angry mode?  ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Netherlands/comments/1gkau61/overreacting_to_a_poc_kid_racism_or_is_it_normal/,1730824450.0,51,bike lane Amsterdam,search,2024-11-05 16:34:10
Netherlands,Your experience living in West,"Hi there!

We are a couple in our 30s who want to buy a house in Amsterdam. We saw one just near the Fort Negen bakery, but we are not familiar with the area, so we are looking for some advice.

Currently, we live near Oosterpark, what I did not like in Oost is that it gives Ankara vibes sometimes, and we did not move here for that :)

So my questions are about demographics, safety, diversity, etc.

It would be great to hear your experiences!

**EDIT:**

I see the post get downvoted, and I believe that this is intolerance towards the people who have their opinions about certain things and should be able to freely express themselves.

People making remarks on single girls/women in the park, teenagers riding fat bikes, ppl with tuned VW Golfs making noise with their music set on a high, and so on... Can you guess from where they are coming? I believe you have visualized that yourself. So instead of banning me from Amsterdam (like someone mentioned in the post) it's better for you to start teaching your kids how to behave in Western societies.

I know that troubling people might be 1% of certain ethnic groups, but they came from your families, and almost never will see Western people behaving like that. So please do your homework first, before banning me!",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Netherlands/comments/1gfrtvw/your_experience_living_in_west/,1730308554.0,18,Amsterdam bike,search,2024-10-30 17:15:54
biketouring,BMX for Touring?,"Hello! My name is Orion and I have wanted to do a cross-country (USA) tour for quite some time.  I currently have a “SE Everyday” BMX fixed gear bike with rear brake pads and 20” (50.8 cm) front and rear wheels. It weighs about 25 pounds (about  11.4 kilograms) and I have had it for about 3 years now. I am very comfortable on it, as it has been my way of getting around my town (to go get coffee, schooling, park trails, etc.). I love this bike, and I am currently planning a cross-country trip via bicycle. I am in high school still, so I don’t have the “funds” per say to go out and get a lighter weight, quote quote nicer bike, if you will. So I was wondering what r/bike touring was thinking about my predicament. Do I work my butt off so I can purchase a new ride, or is it possible to cross country tour on my BMX? The distance will be approximately ~4,500 miles (6,400 kilometers). I am a healthy teenage male who is average to under average weight for my age, and I’m not looking to do it the fastest, but rather I would like to be able to go through places that are more remote in order to get to smaller cities/places, and I want to make sure I won’t be super tired :P",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/biketouring/comments/83q0cp/bmx_for_touring/,1520805776.0,7,fallback_new,fallback,2018-03-11 22:02:56
biketouring,Which marathon supreme set?,"I'm thinking it's time to change my rear tire because there are 
[cracks](http://imgur.com/a/c8szp) that show the green-guard layer.


I want to go with used ones and i have a choice between two supreme sets.

Both come with inner tubes, although i prefer presta valves to schrader valves.

I can fit both sets on my rims, so i'm wondering whether one set has an advantage over the other besides the inner tube valve preference and price?    

I've also noticed that the wider tire from the 40eu set has some minor damage in [picture 5/8](http://mediapool.cubicle.rs/market/img/classifieds/1277vVcn1707924293_57fbea7107343.jpeg)
